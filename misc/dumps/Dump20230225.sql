But have you thought about bringing a canopy tent with you to your next camping trip?</p>\n<p>Whether you will be camping on the beach, in the woods, or in a different environment, a canopy tent has a surprisingly large number of uses and benefits. Following are some of the ways in which a canopy tent can make your next camping trip one which is more convenient and enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>1. Give yourself some extra shade</h2>\n<p>You will probably spend a lot of time hiking, sunbathing, swimming, fishing, or finding other ways to enjoy the bounties of nature on your camping trip. But after many hours out in the sun, you may want to come back to your campsite and relax and do something less active.</p>\n<p>If so, you’ll welcome the shade of your canopy tent. While you might have brought another tent with you in which to sleep, chances are good it doesn&#8217;t have the airflow of a canopy tent with open sides. A canopy tent can be a more comfortable way to unwind and can keep you more closely in touch with nature.</p>\n<h2>2. Keep enjoying your campsite in the rain</h2>\n<p>It could also end up raining during your camping trip. But that rain does not have to send you retreating into your dome tent or other camping tent. So long as it is not too windy and the rain is not coming in at you sideways, you can just sit under your canopy and remain dry as you continue to enjoy the scenery.</p>\n<p>If necessary, you can also attach one or more sidewalls to <a href=\"/blog/rain-camping-without-waterproof-tent/\">protect against rain or wind</a> coming in from the sides.</p>\n<h2>3. Provide yourself with an “entryway” to your tent where you are able to get clean and dry off</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re camping in a rainy climate, it can cause difficulties when it comes to getting into your tent to sleep without smearing mud and dripping rainwater inside.</p>\n<p>A typical solution is to set up a large tarp overhead so that you have somewhere that you can strip off wet clothes and take off your boots before climbing into something warm and dry. That way, you do not track mud and water into your sleeping space.</p>\n<p>A canopy tent can fulfill the same function, and it can be faster and easier to manage than the tarp, and a lot more aesthetically appealing too. Many campgrounds may not appreciate tarps (or even allow them, in some cases), but may have no issue at all with a canopy tent.</p>\n<p>Note: If you decide to put a tarp underneath the canopy tent, make sure that the tent poles are not positioned on top of it with the sides extending out beyond the range of the shelter. You do not want water to collect along the perimeter of the tarp and then run down to where the poles are. If that happens, it will pool in the exact area you are trying so hard to keep dry.</p>\n<h2>4. Store extra items underneath the canopy tent</h2>\n<p>Along with providing you with an entry area where you can clean off before getting into your tent to sleep, a canopy tent can also offer you a sheltered space under which to store your camping gear.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/camping-in-the-rain.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Family using canopy to protect themselves from rain while camping\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>You will not want to have all of your supplies in the tent where you sleep, but you also will not want to leave them out where they can get wet. A canopy tent offers an ideal solution.</p>\n<h2>5. Prepare food and keep it dry during the rain (though we caution you against cooking under your tent)</h2>\n<p>It is not a good idea to <a href=\"/blog/grilling-under-canopy/\">cook underneath a canopy tent</a> even if it is raining. Even though there is airflow, it is a safety issue. It also can be bad for the tent itself, as smoke, flame, and grease all can damage a tent permanently.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there are foods you can prepare and enjoy on your camping trip which do not require cooking. Getting those foods ready is sure a lot easier and more enjoyable when you are not getting soaked to do it (or getting crumbs inside the tent you’ll sleep in).</p>\n<p>Plus, the food itself will stay dry as you are preparing it. That can keep your meal from being ruined by the rain. Nobody wants to bite into a soggy sandwich that is falling apart.</p>\n<h2>6. You could sleep under a canopy tent if you wanted</h2>\n<p>A canopy tent isn’t the <a href=\"/blog/camping-tent-buying-guide/\">traditional option for sleeping</a> during a camping trip—but maybe you don’t want to sleep in a completely enclosed environment.</p>\n<p>There is nothing stopping you from laying on the ground underneath your canopy tent and enjoying the open, fresh air as you fall asleep. And if you want some privacy, you can always just put up some sidewalls.</p>\n<h2>7. Create a common area</h2>\n<p>Camping with friends or extended family, with each of you bringing your own separate tents? Where will you hang out during the day to talk and eat?</p>\n<p>You are going to want a common area to gather so that you can spend time together. A canopy tent gives you a sheltered common space that you can share as a larger group. Depending on the size of your group, you might even want to bring more than one.</p>\n<h3><strong>A Canopy Tent Can Bring Comfort and Convenience to Your Next Camping Trip</strong></h3>\n<p>Bringing a canopy tent with you on your next camping trip means packing an extra supply, but it can do a lot to enhance your campsite. With their compact, lightweight designs, canopy tents are easy to stow in your trunk and carry to a campsite, so long as it is not too distant from your vehicle. We suggest you check <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2J4yzT3\" target=\"_blank\">this canopy tent</a> out, it might just be the perfect one for next camping trip!</p>\n<p>With protection against sun and rain and a place to store supplies, prepare food, and take off wet and muddy attire, you might never want to camp without one again.</p>','/img/rain-falling-on-lake.jpg','Camping'),('autumn-camping-survival-guide',13,'Autumn camping survival guide','The leaves are starting to change colors. But, there is still time to get a nice camping trip in before it gets too cold.','Eric Schroeder','October 1, 2017','<p>Going camping this autumn? Then here are a few tips on how to get the most from your trip:</p>\n<h4>Preparation is key</h4>\n<p>To enjoy your autumn camping trip to the max, put the right preparation in at the right time. Choose your location in good time, taking into account the time you have, your method of travel, the numbers in the group, the likely weather and what you want to achieve from the trip. When it comes to the latter, consider if you want to get away from it all or have a rollicking family holiday with visitor attractions on hand to enjoy.</p>\n<h4>The finer detail</h4>\n<p>Once you’ve chosen your preferred location plan the finer detail of your camping trip, check local weather reports to see how robust a tent you’ll require and what clothing you’ll need. Also, check how close you’ll be to amenities like shops for basic food supplies or whether you’ll have to take all of your food supplies with you.</p>\n<h4>Your equipment</h4>\n<p>Regarding the equipment you pack, a lot will depend on what sort of camping experience you want and how basic or not you wish it to be. For autumn, you’ll require a rain proof tent and an additional waterproof ground sheet to keep moisture out. Also, take the <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com\">best pop up canopy tent</a> you can find to provide additional shelter for during the day, so you can enjoy the views without being in too exposed a position.</p>\n<p>Pack a mat to insulate you from the cold ground and the best (preferably) four season sleeping bag you can find to keep you warm when the temperature drops - the mummy style ones work best. For catering, pack a camping stove, matches in a waterproof container, a mess kit and a filled water container. Always ensure you have adequate lighting, carry a first aid kit, whistle and survival bag or blanket.</p>\n<h4>Your clothing</h4>\n<p>Autumn can pose a conundrum when it comes to clothing, so it’s best to take several <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/layering-basics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">layers</a> you can add as the temperature necessitates, as each layer will trap more air, creating additional insulation. Thermal underwear is a great way to stay warm and comfortable, without adding too much bulk, so try a merino wool base layer.</p>\n<p>For your middle layers, look to bulkier clothes such as a thick wool jumper and a heavy fleece, then add a thinner top layer that will keep out the wind and rain. Take purpose made hiking trousers rather than jeans to keep your legs warm; and don’t neglect the value small items, such as a hat, scarf and gloves will add if the temperature drops – they’ll make a huge difference to your comfort level - so take them along.  Wear robust boots that you’ve warn in and that leave room for thick, cosy socks.</p>\n<h4>Before you leave</h4>\n<p>Tell a trusted person where you are going, your route (if you are hiking) and when you expect to be back.</p>\n<h4>Arrive in daylight</h4>\n<p>Whether you are driving, hiking or using public transport to reach your destination, allow yourself sufficient travelling time to ensure you arrive in daylight, so that you can put up your tent with ease, as you don’t want to be tackling a tent in the dark.</p>\n<p>So there you have a few tips to help you make the most of your autumnal camping trip, now you’ve just got time to start planning.</p>','/img/autumn-survival-guide.jpg','Camping'),('baby-beach-essentials',37,'12 Things to Bring With You to Enjoy the Beach With a Baby','We comprised a list of beach essentials for families with newborn babies so you can be fully prepared on vacation this summer.','Andrew Farkas','March 8, 2019','<p>Planning an outing to the beach with a baby? If so, there are certain essential supplies which you will need to bring to ensure your little one&rsquo;s safety and comfort. Below are some recommendations to ensure the that you both have a wonderful time! Use this list in addition to our recent post on <a href=\"/blog/essentials-for-beach-trip\">fun things to bring to the beach</a>!</p>\n<h3>Canopy tent</h3>\n<p>One supply which you will definitely want to bring to the beach if you will have your baby with you is a <a href=\"/\">canopy tent</a>. It is important to protect your own skin from harmful UV rays, but your baby&rsquo;s skin is even more sensitive and needs extra protection.</p>\n<p>Plus, a canopy tent will also make for a cooler, more comfortable environment for you and your baby to relax and enjoy the sparkle of the waves and the pleasant sea breeze.</p>\n<h3>Cotton Clothes and a Sun Hat</h3>\n<p>Dress your baby in convenient layers of cotton so that you can layer up or down as needed. Cotton is a good fabric for regulating temperature. While a canopy tent will provide lots of shade throughout the day, you should also have your baby wear a sun hat to provide even more protection.</p>\n<h3>Sunscreen</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"/best-baby-beach-tents\">baby beach tent</a> should to some extent prevent sunburn, but not entirely. Morning or late afternoon sunlight may still potentially cause sunburn. Plus, you probably will not spend the entire time underneath the shade of the canopy.</p>\n<p>Because babies have sensitive skin, use a sunscreen which won&rsquo;t cause irritation. That means choosing a sunscreen specifically for babies. It is usually best to keep outings with babies relatively short, but if you do end up spending more than a couple of hours at the beach, do not forget to reapply.</p>\n<h3>Sunglasses</h3>\n<p>Your baby&apos;s eyes need sun protection, just like yours. Get a pair of sunglasses for your baby to wear as you are walking on the beach.</p>\n<h3>Inflatable Pool</h3>\n<p>If your baby is too small to play with you in the water, he or she does not need to miss out on all the fun. Bring a small inflatable pool and set it up under the canopy where you and your baby can play safely away from the ocean currents. This is also an option if the ocean water causes your baby irritation (from the salt) or anxiety.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/baby-beach-toys.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Toddler playing with toys on the beach\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Toys</h3>\n<p>Beach toys are a must to keep your baby entertained for the duration of your outing to the beach. A few simple plastic toys such as buckets and shovels should suffice.</p>\n<p>In fact, a plastic shovel is also useful since you can use it to dig a small pit in the sand. This can keep your baby&rsquo;s toys more easily contained, and it also provides a cooler surface for your baby to sit on. It may discourage crawling away as well.</p>\n<h3>First-Aid Kit</h3>\n<p>You do not want to take the risk of your baby getting injured at the beach with no first aid. Make sure you have a fully-stocked kit with you at all times.</p>\n<h3>Towels or Picnic Blankets</h3>\n<p>While sand has a fun and intriguing texture and is great for sensory play, it can be a bit too abrasive for sensitive young skin. So <a href=\"https://www.potterybarnkids.com/shop/baby/beach/baby-beach-wraps/\" target=\"_blank\">bring towels or picnic blankets</a> with you to lay out on the sand so your baby is not in direct, constant contact with the coarse grains. This can also help protect your baby from heat from the ground.</p>\n<h3>Food, Water, and Formula</h3>\n<p>If your baby is still being fed on formula, you can bring it with you. Otherwise, you can pack solid foods for an older baby. Keep them easy to eat, and if possible, try and serve them to your baby item by item. This will prevent them from getting sand in them.</p>\n<p>While you are it, bring plenty of water with you! Both you and your baby will need to stay hydrated in order to enjoy the day. It isn&rsquo;t just the sun which can dehydrate you on the beach. Dry winds can make the issue worse.</p>\n<h3>Cooler</h3>\n<p>A cooler will be very helpful both for keeping foods and beverages at a comfortable and refreshing temperature on a hot, sunny day.</p>\n<h3>Spray Bottle</h3>\n<p>Speaking of cool and refreshing, you might also want to think about packing a spray bottle with water. Why? If you or your baby become overheated, one fast way to cool down without actually taking a dip in the ocean is just to spray a little cool water.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/toddlers-playing-beach.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Toddler playing in the sand\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Float Vest, Armbands, etc.</h3>\n<p>If your baby is old enough to play with you in the water, you&rsquo;re going to need to bring a float suit or armbands or another <a href=\"https://www.lifejacketadvisor.com/best-toddler-swim-vests-floatation-devices/\" target=\"_blank\">flotation device designed to help keep them safe</a>. There are a few important things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A baby may get uncomfortably cold in the ocean very fast. Even if you feel fine, if you notice that your baby looks to be shivering, returning to your site right away. A warm towel can help your baby get comfortable again quickly.</li>\n<li>You must hold onto your baby firmly at all times. A flotation device alone is not sufficient to ensure your baby&rsquo;s safety. Drifting away is just as dangerous as sinking.</li>\n<li>Some beaches have riptides. Never bring a baby into the water when riptides are active. They pose a major threat to swimmers of all ages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not all babies like swimming in the ocean, so if yours doesn&rsquo;t, or if you don&rsquo;t feel confident holding on to him or her, don&rsquo;t push it. Just enjoy spending time together on the shore.</p>\n<p>With the Right Supplies, You and Your Baby Can Look Forward to a Perfect Day at the Beach</p>\n<p>Now you have a list of essential supplies to bring with you for your next outing to the beach with your baby. Think carefully, as there may be additional items that you want to bring which are not on this list. Being well-stocked for your day out can make the difference between whether your outing is a stressful one or whether it is a day of relaxation and fun.</p>','/img/baby-beach-essentials.jpg','Beach'),('beach-good-for-health',19,'Health benefits of a beach vacation','Did you know that there are proven health benefits associated with a relaxing trip to the beach?','Mark Yates','April 14, 2018','<p>A beach holiday, unbeknownst to many, is necessary for our overall health and well-being. According to marine biologists, since it\'s springtime, we should have a holiday at the beach planned already! If you don\'t have one scheduled yet, you should definitely reconsider as being near water coaxes our active brains into releasing serotonin, oxytocin, and dopamine, which are what we call as happy chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>Continue reading as what we have below are the reasons why a holiday at the beach is necessary!</p>\n\n<h4>Water helps us retain our natural state.</h4>\n \n<p>From the onset of our lives, we\'re mostly made of water. As a matter of fact, the bodies of babies contain water at an astounding rate of 75%. As we age, however, we become drier as it is reduced to 60%. As for our brains, three-fourths of them are made of water. Our bones, on the other hand, consist 31% of water.</p>\n \n<p>The brain which sits in a clear and colorless cerebrospinal fluid, reacts to water fondly as our ancient ancestors evolved from swimming, then crawling to walking. Fetuses even have gill-slit structures during their earliest stages of development. Water that\'s in our cells, as it was found, is comparable to sea water.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.health.com/stress/why-nature-sounds-are-relaxing\">biological connection of humans to water</a> triggers an instant response inside our brains. This is why when you\'re near the ocean, you immediately feel as if you are in a good state or in the exact place where you need to be.</p>\n\n<h4>We are more relaxed when we\'re by the coast.</h4>\n\n<p>Even the slightest hint or sight of the ocean calms us subconsciously. Several areas of our brains that have been associated with more empathy and less stress are instantly activated when we take a closer look at scenes of nature. Pictures of landscapes in urban areas elicit activity in areas of our brains that are associated with stress. However, when we see pictures of nature, there\'s a heightened activity in parts that are linked with emotional stability, positive outlook, and recollection of wonderful memories.</p>\n\n<p>The coast or any body of water creates faster positive reactions in us. Several studies have been conducted, which all found that coastal images are more effective at activating our reward systems, the areas in our brains that are full of opioid receptors, which trigger feelings of wellness.<p>\n \n<h4>Looking at pictures may be good but being near water is even better.</h4>\n\n<p>Looking at pictures of the sea may relax us but being immersed in nature wins over anything else. Water rejuvenates our tired minds. In today\'s fast-paced world, we have more social media networks to update, websites to refresh, and screens to watch. Our fatigued brains require recharging. Fortunately, water helps in making that happen. What\'s interesting is that nature doesn’t simply rejuvenate our tired minds, but it also gives as an attention-restoring experience!</p>\n\n<h4>Blue soothes the soul.</h4>\n\n<p>Blue, as it turns out, can be considered as the favorite color of the world. Hundreds of thousands of research projects conducted all over the world concluded that blue is the favorite color of people, regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.</p>\n\n<p>We are not really surprised as we have evolved on the planet that\'s full of shades of blue. If you think about it, it actually makes sense why blue would stimulate an emotional response that\'s 100% positive in us. Try to be surrounded by the color blue and notice feeling less fatigued or claustrophobic.</p>\n  \n<p>By now, we are pretty certain that we\'ve convinced you to finally book that beach holiday you\'ve been postponing for so long! Before you head for the beach, here are the things you need to bring with you to enjoy it all the more:</p>\n\n<h4>Beach Day Essentials for a More Relaxed Beach Holiday</h4>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Sunscreen –</strong> it is important that you protect yourself from the harmful rays of the sun. Pack a bottle of sunscreen and make sure that you reapply as often as possible to get your needed coverage.</li>\n	<li><strong>A suit + an extra pair –</strong> it is inevitable for someone to spill something on you while at the beach as everyone is carefree being near water. You are also likely to rip your swimsuit, so make sure you\'re ready with a spare in case that happens. If you\'ll be with your family, bring a spare for each family member. That way, you\'ll be able to enjoy the water and the waves the entire day!</li>\n	<li><strong>Extra towels –</strong> obviously, you will need a towel when you want to dry off. It is smart to bring a spare as well as towels get soaked rather quickly!</li>\n	<li><strong>Beach tent –</strong> this one is an absolute must-have when at the beach. A beach tent provides myriads of benefits: it provides better protection from the sun and it protects your belongings from being blown away by the wind or getting wet. It even offers privacy!</li>\n	<li><strong>A stocked cooler –</strong> a beach day takes so much of our energy, especially to kids, so you must have a cooler stocked with water, munchies, and juice boxes to keep tummies full and the energy up for hours!</li>\n	<li><strong>Clothes and cover ups –</strong> there are beach-side restaurants that won\'t serve families that are still sporting their swimsuits; therefore, you need to pack trendy backup outfits or cover ups just in case.</li>\n	<li><strong>Beach toys –</strong> make you and your children\'s time at the beach is even more fun and memorable by bringing shovels and pails to make sandcastles with! To make it even better, have a fun water-side competition!</li>\n	<li><strong>Goggles and floaties –</strong> these are swim-time essentials for kids. The floaties can give you your much-needed peace of mind. As for the goggles, it\'ll help the kids see the wonders below the surface.</li>\n	<li><strong>First-aid kit –</strong> of course, you wouldn\'t want a bump or little scrape to ruin a fun day at the beach. Be prepared and bring your own first-aid kit!</li>\n	<li><strong>Waterproof camera –</strong> last, but not the least, is a waterproof camera. You would want to document a wonderful day without worrying about an expensive camera getting wet or stolen. A disposable waterproof camera is the perfect solution!</li>\n</ul>','/img/bicycles-on-beach.jpg','Beach'),('beach-picnic',43,'9 Tips for the Perfect Beach Picnic','We highlight the essentials you\'ll need to get the most out of your beach picnic this summer','Andrew Farkas','May 14, 2019','<p>If you will be spending a day at the beach, you may be packing a picnic lunch so that you can continue to enjoy the sun and surf all day uninterrupted.</p>\r <p>While a picnic on the beach can be delightful, it does pose some obvious logistical challenges involving both sand and wind. Following are some tips to help you pack and prepare so that you can enjoy the perfect picnic on the beach.</p>\r <h3>Know the rules</h3>\r <p>First of all, look at the rules and regulations for the beach where you are intending to enjoy your picnic. While many beaches allow you to eat or drink what you wish, many have restrictions on alcohol. Some also have restrictions on other foods and beverages. You should check to see if the rules mention anything with regards to tents or umbrellas as well.</p>\r <h3>Pack finger foods.</h3>\r <p>There is no reason to overcomplicate your packing or haul more supplies then you need to. Instead of bringing along a lot of utensils, just <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/the-best-foods-to-pack-for-the-beach-91115\" target=\"_blank\">pack foods which you can eat by hand</a>.</p>\r <h3>Bring plenty to drink</h3>\r <p>Getting dehydrated on the beach is as effortless as showing up and sitting down. Even if you are not running around in the hot sun or swimming, you will probably lose a lot of fluids quickly.</p>\r <p>So pack more beverages than you think you will need. Not only will they quench your thirst, but they should also help you to function at your best so you can make the most of your day at the beach.</p>\r <h3>Pack plastic or paper dishes</h3>\r <p>Think about bringing some plastic or paper plates with you. Even if you are only eating finger foods, keeping them in their plastic wrap between bites will not necessarily help to keep sand out of them.</p>\r <p>While you are at it, consider packing a small bag for trash so you have somewhere to throw your dirty dishes without having to walk to the nearest trashcan right away. This also prevents you from having to take multiple trips to the trash. You can just take care of your garbage when you are ready to pack up and leave.</p>\r <h3>Do bring a cooler or frozen water bottles</h3>\r <p>If you will be spending a full day at the beach, you will want a way to keep your food and beverages cool and unspoiled. To make this happen, simply pack them in a quality cooler which can protect them from the hot sun for hours.</p>\r <p>If you do not have a cooler, or simply do not feel like lugging one around, one good idea is to put your water bottles in the freezer for a few hours before you head out to the beach. That way, they will start out as ice. By the time you&apos;re ready for a drink, hopefully they will have thawed enough for you to do so, but still be cold enough to be completely refreshing.</p>\r <div class=\"row\">\r     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\r         <img src=\"/img/picnic-in-sand.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Couple sitting in the sand, having a picnic\">\r   </div>\r </div>\r <br />\r <h3>Bring layers</h3>\r <p>Most of this advice assumes that you will be at the beach on a hot day. But this may not be your plan. You might be planning a picnic on a beach which is cool or even cold, especially in areas subject to heavy winds.</p>\r <p>So that you can eat comfortably, bring layers of clothing. Even if the sun is shining and it is relatively warm away from the water, it could be quite a bit cooler than you expect on the beach. A warm hat can go a long way toward keeping you comfortable as well.</p>\r <h3>Bring a picnic blanket</h3>\r <p>One of the single best things that you can do to keep sand away from your food and plates is to sit down on a surface other than sand. It is well worthwhile to pack a full-size picnic blanket for your outing.</p>\r <p>Don&rsquo;t have a picnic blanket? That&rsquo;s okay&mdash;there are other options which are just as easy. If you have an extra tablecloth, you can sit on that. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, you can <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EbKyM9\" target=\"_blank\">bring some large beach towels</a> to sit on instead.</p>\r <h3>Sit underneath a canopy tent</h3>\r <p>What is over your head matters just as much as what you are sitting on. You are going to need a way to keep the sun from beating down on you all day. Assuming you&rsquo;ve checked the rules and regulations and you are good to go, consider <a href=\"/\">bringing along a canopy tent</a>.</p>\r <p>Why is a canopy tent the best choice for the beach? The tent gives you shade, protecting you from UV rays and making your picnic spot more comfortable when the sun is high in the sky. At the same time, the open sides allow unobstructed airflow, keeping your site breathable. You also get to enjoy your view of the waves unimpeded while you eat.</p>\r <h3>Bring along some baby powder</h3>\r <p>No matter how many precautions you take to keep sand from getting all over yourself, your clothes, your picnic blanket, and your other supplies, it is a guarantee that it is going to happen.</p>\r <p>The best way to deal with it is to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/bring-baby-powder-to-the-beach-to-easily-remove-sand-1709669696\" target=\"_blank\">pack some baby powder</a>. As unusual as it sounds, it can help you to clean up sand quickly and easily.</p>\r <p>Baby powder has absorbent properties. Those properties help it to soak water out of wet sand. It is the water which makes the sand so sticky. So when you dust a surface with baby powder, it dries the sand out a bit, making it easier to wipe off.</p>\r <p><strong>The Key to the Perfect Picnic at the Beach is to Arrive Well-Prepared</strong></p>\r <p>If you just stuff some food in a bag and make your way to the beach, you might have a good time. But what you really want is to have the best picnic at the beach ever. With a canopy tent to provide you with shade, finger food which is easy to eat and clean up, plenty of cold water to stay hydrated, and baby powder to clean up sand, you can truly look forward to the perfect picnic.</p>\r','/img/beach-picnic.jpg','Beach'),('beach-regulations',41,'10 Beach Regulations To Be Aware of This Summer','From fires to food to activities to pets; we check out the most frequently asked about prohibited items for the beach so you can be prepared.','Jack Manning','April 22, 2019','<p>If you are planning a vacation to the beach, you should look up the regulations and rules for that beach before you go. Since these can vary from one beach to the next, it is best not to make assumptions. Once you are aware of the regulations, you can pack appropriately for your trip.</p>\n<p>Following is a list of possible beach regulations to be aware of. Not all beaches have these rules, and others may have rules pertaining to items not listed here. Still, it gives you a starting point for what to think about when you are preparing for your beach vacation.</p>\n<h3>Alcohol</h3>\n<p>Quite a few beaches have rules against bringing alcohol onto the premises. As this is one of the most common regulations, you should plan by default to leave alcohol at home unless you know for certain that it is permitted.</p>\n<h3>Pets</h3>\n<p>While some beaches are pet-friendly, many prohibit the presence of dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. Still others may permit the presence of pets, but only during certain seasons. If a pet will be traveling with you, make sure that you are visiting <a href=\"https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/region/united_states/\" target=\"_blank\">beaches which can accommodate your animal companion</a>.</p>\n<h3>Generators, loud noise, motorized water vehicles, etc.</h3>\n<p>Loud noises at beaches are typically frowned upon, especially when produced by motorized water vehicles or generators on shore. There may even be a specific maximum decibel level which is permitted. If so, find out what it is.</p>\n<p>Some beaches prohibit the use of generators altogether (even &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; ones), and may also ban motorized water vehicles for reasons relating to safety.</p>\n<h3>Canopy tents and umbrellas</h3>\n<p>Rules and regulations for using <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">canopy tents and umbrellas on beaches</a> can be surprisingly specific. Some beaches require that you only use tents or umbrellas which have been approved by the local authorities, or that any umbrellas or tents you use do not exceed specific measurements.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, not all beaches are so stringent about this requirement, and many will allow you to set up a canopy tent or umbrella of your choice.</p>\n<h3>Activities</h3>\n<p>There can be numerous regulations concerning activities on the beach or in the water. On certain areas of the beach, you can for example be restricted from throwing balls or Frisbees. As already discussed, you may not be able to operate motorized watercraft. There may be restrictions on fishing. Many beaches also prohibit you from swimming outside of designated areas. There may even be areas of the beach where you cannot run or jog.</p>\n<p>If a beach has lifeguards or other personnel, you are expected to immediately respond to any sort of signal or order you receive. This is not just for your safety, but for the safety of other beachgoers as well.</p> \n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/trash-recycling.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Trash and Recycling Signs\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Trash and recycling</h3>\n<p>One of the more obvious rules which you will find in effect at any beach you go to is a policy against littering. But there may be very specific rules regarding what to do with various forms of trash or waste.</p>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with these rules, especially if you are going to be camping overnight and the beach does not offer access to toilet facilities.</p>\n<h3>Open fires and/or picnicking</h3>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.101corpuschristi.com/vacation/4168\" target=\"_blank\">beaches permit open fires or barbecuing</a>, but quite a few prohibit these activities. You certainly would not want to plan a party at the beach only to find that you will not be able to prepare any food when you arrive.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/beach-fire.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Fire on a beach\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>Likewise, a rule like this could put a real cramp in your camping plans if you were not aware of it before pitching a tent.</p>\n<p>These are not the only regulations to look up when it comes to eating at the beach, either. There are beaches where you&apos;re actually not permitted to bring any form of food at all. That means that you cannot pack a picnic lunch to enjoy.</p>\n<p>As already discussed, a ban on alcoholic beverages is common, even though it is not ubiquitous. But some beaches also will put a limit on how many nonalcoholic beverages you can bring with you. This is something to look up as well before making your plans.</p>\n<h3>Attire</h3>\n<p>Rules regarding attire can range quite a bit from beach to beach. Some beaches are literally clothing-optional. Others may have rules about what you can wear, and what level of dressing, undressing, or changing clothing you can do in view of the public.</p>\n<p>It is very important to make sure that you are familiar with these rules. If you are used to clothing-optional beaches, for example, rules at other beaches may take you by surprise. Be aware of cultural conventions in the area where you are beach-going, and how they might impact your experience.</p>\n<h3>Overnight stays</h3>\n<p>There are many beaches where you can pitch a tent or hang a hammock and spend the night. But there are many others were overnight stays are forbidden. This may include overnight parking as well. Find out exactly what time the beach closes. This may be a specific hour, or it might depend on when the sun is setting.</p>\n<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>\n<p>Finally, you must respect the animals, birds, fish and other marine species which call the beach home, as well as the plant life which grows there. Usually, that means keeping your distance from animals, and not feeding them.</p>\n<p>You now are familiar with some common rules, regulations and restrictions governing your activities at the beach. You do not want to pack your canopy tent and picnic lunch only to arrive at a beach and find out that you cannot have these items with you.</p>\n<p>You also should not try to circumvent beach regulations. You may think that you can get away with breaking the rules (or your kids might think that), but if somebody does spot you in violation, you could receive a hefty fine and be asked to leave.</p>','/img/prohibited-sign.jpg','Beach'),('beaches-pt-1',77,'Our Favorite Beaches: Pacific Northwest','Checkout part 1 of our 4 part series talking about our favorite beaches as we focus on the pacific northwest.','Hank Murry','May 29, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n  <small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite beaches: <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-1\">Part 1: Pacific Northwest</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-2\">Part 2: California</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-3\">Part 3: Northeast Coast</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-4\">Part 4: Southeast Coast</a>.</small>\n</div>\n  \n <p>If you want to experience an unforgettable beach vacation, consider heading to the Pacific Northwest to explore its rugged coastline.</p>\n \n <p>This isn&apos;t the part of the world most of us picture when we think of heading to the beach. We tend to picture warm, tropical climates and sandy shores.</p>\n \n <p>It is true that the Pacific Northwest gets a lot of rain, but during the summer, it is mostly sunny.</p>\n \n <p>Plus, while much of the coast is rocky, you may be surprised just how much sand there is to enjoy.</p>\n \n <h2>Why Visit Pacific Northwest Beaches?</h2>\n \n <ul>\n <li>Rugged scenery. The high cliffs and erosion-sculpted sea stacks along the Pacific Northwest coast are some of the most dramatic beach scenery you will ever see.</li>\n \n <li>Seclusion. If you visit popular beaches in densely urban parts of the country like Southern California, you are often wading through more crowds than surf. This is rarely the case in the Pacific Northwest. Many of this region&apos;s beaches remain secluded even during the summer.</li>\n \n <li>Agates. If you enjoy rock collecting, you will have the chance to collect hundreds of beautiful agates along Pacific Northwest beaches.</li>\n \n <li>Surfing. Some of the beaches in Oregon and Washington State are renowned for their incredible waves!</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h3>1. Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</h3>\n \n <p>When you picture the Pacific Northwest, what do you visualize? Redwoods? Mountains? Probably not sweeping sand dunes that look like they belong in a desert. But that is exactly what you will find should you venture to the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=42465\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</a> along the Oregon Coast.</p>\n \n <p>According to the Forest Service, the dunes comprise &quot;one of the largest expanses of temperate coastal sand dunes in the world.&quot;</p> \n \n <p>While there are a number of places you can pitch a tent in and around the Oregon Dunes, we recommend Umpqua Sand Camping through the Forest Service. You can camp here during any season; just make sure you make a reservation in advance during the summer.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You&apos;ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The Oregon Dunes offer a distinctive environment like no other. Where else can you explore dunes like these so close to the sea and forest? The ecology is unusual and the landscape is constantly changing. In fact, the Oregon Dunes made such a big impact on sci-fi author Frank Herbert that they helped to inspire Dune!</p>\n \n <h3>2. Kalaloch Campground at Olympic National Park, WA</h3>\n \n <p>Why visit just any beach on the Washington State coastline when you can camp at Olympic National Park? It is hard to beat the location of <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232464\" target=\"_blank\">Kalaloch Campground</a> on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>\n \n <p>With the campground&apos;s location on a bluff, you can enjoy a breathtaking view of the ocean. Beach access is available. You&apos;ll also be surrounded by gorgeous trees. In fact, there is an iconic landmark here known as the Tree of Life. This startling tree is straddled in a gap between two bluffs. While it is flourishing in this unusual spot, its roots are largely exposed, giving it a resemblance to the mystical Tree of Life that plays a role in diverse mythologies.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You&apos;ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Did we mention the cool Tree of Life? Also, you&apos;ll be right at Olympic National Park with its rainforest trails, waterfalls, beaches and snowy mountains. There is literally something for everyone in this park with its incredibly diverse ecology.</p>\n \n <p>Be sure to make a reservation during peak season. Kalaloch Campground is popular, and sites can go fast. If you are staying here on the off-season, however, there is no way to make a reservation. It is first-come, first-served.</p>\n \n <h3>3. South Beach State Park at Newport, Oregon</h3>\n \n <p>Heading back to Oregon, you will find the <a href=\"https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=149\" target=\"_blank\">South Beach State Park</a> right next to the town of Newport.</p>\n \n <p>This park offers a classic sandy beach experience and is a popular choice for families. There is a convenient Jetty Trail on which you can jog or cycle, as well as an equestrian trail, disc golf course, playground, and horse-shoe pits.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You&apos;ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>South Beach State Park offers excellent amenities and entertainment right on-site. But you also will be close to Beaver Creek Natural Area, Yaguina Head Lighthouse, Yaguina Bay Lighthouse, and other destinations.</p> \n \n <p>You can also head into Newport itself to visit attractions like the Oregon Coast Aquarium and the Newport Discovery Zoo. And don&apos;t miss out on other nearby beaches like Agate Beach and Nye Beach.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Camping at Pacific Northwest Beaches</h2>\n \n <p>Now that you have your eye on some exciting beach destinations in the Pacific Northwest, here are a few tips for comfortable camping.</p>\n \n <ul>\n <li>Pack layers. While the Pacific Northwest is known to be a temperate region, it can get to be blazing hot during the day over the summer. But it can also cool down significantly at night. So, you should pack layers of clothing so you can be comfortable throughout the day and night.</li>\n \n <li>Check the forecast for precipitation. If you are visiting during summer, this might not be a big deal, since these are the drier months. But during the rest of the year, it is very important to be aware of the possibility of rain and prepare for it.</li>\n \n <li>Pack a <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach canopy</a>. This shelter can give you some protection from the sun and light wind (see below).</li>\n \n <li>Check the forecast for heavy wind. While many people know to associate rain with the Pacific Northwest, those who are not from this region often do not realize that wind can be a big deal along the coast. Really heavy winds can damage a canopy tent or camping tent. So, try to avoid scheduling your beach visits for super windy days—and choose a canopy tent that includes air vents to prevent billowing.</li>\n \n <li>Book ahead. Place your reservation well in advance at popular beaches. If you are visiting a beach with first-come, first-served sites, have a backup plan ready in case all sites are full.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h4>Enjoy the Rugged Beaches of the Pacific Northwest</h4>\n \n <p>The beaches of the Pacific Northwest tend to be overlooked, but that is part of their appeal. You will love the wide open expanses of sand, the towering cliffs and sea stacks, and the rugged solitude of these Oregon and Washington beaches.</p>','/img/pacific-northwest-beach.jpg','Beach'),('beaches-pt-2',79,'Our Favorite Beaches: California','Checkout part 2 of our 4 part series talking about our favorite beaches as we focus on California.','Hank Murry','June 20, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n  <small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite beaches: <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-1\">Part 1: Pacific Northwest</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-2\">Part 2: California</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-3\">Part 3: Northeast Coast</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-4\">Part 4: Southeast Coast</a>.</small>\n</div>\n   \n <p>Welcome to the second installment in our series on the best beaches around the country! In our first installment, we introduced you to our <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-1\">favorite beaches in the Pacific Northwest</a>, with a focus on Oregon and Washington. In this installment, we are going to introduce you to some of the finest beaches in California.</p>\n \n <p>While we typically feature locations where you can camp overnight, for this post, we will diverge a bit. Some of Southern California’s most iconic beaches do not support overnight camping since they are in dense urban areas.</p>\n \n <h2>Why Visit California Beaches?</h2>\n <ul>\n <li>The classic California experience. What is the first thing you picture when you think of California? For a lot of people, the answer is the beach. Not only that, but if you ask someone to imagine a random beach, there is a good chance their minds will jump right to CA. If you are going to be anywhere in the state, this is your chance to experience those world-famous beaches for yourself.</li>\n \n <li>Warm, sunny weather. While the Pacific Northwest beaches we recommended are beautiful, there is no denying that for much of the year, they can be cold, windy and rainy. If you visit beaches in southern and central California, you can look forward to balmy, comfortable weather and warmer sea conditions for swimming.</li>\n \n <li>Great surf. Like Pacific Northwest beaches, beaches throughout California are popular destinations for catching big waves.</li>\n \n <li>Close to other attractions. A lot of the best beaches in California are clustered around San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, putting you in close reach of other exciting destinations.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h3>1. Laguna Beach – Crystal Cove State Park Beach and More</h3>\n \n <p>Laguna Beach is a city in Orange County that draws around six million visitors a year. It is home to more than two dozen gorgeous beaches you will have to see to believe. Some of the most popular beaches at <a href=\"https://www.visitlagunabeach.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Laguna Beach</a> include Aliso Beach, Heisler Park Beaches, Thousand Steps Beach, Crystal Cove State Park Beach, and Crescent Beach.</p>\n \n <p>While you cannot camp at every beach in the Laguna Beach area, you can pitch a tent at <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=644\" target=\"_blank\">Crystal Cove State Park</a> Beach.</p> \n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Not only will you love swimming and sunbathing at Laguna Beach’s beaches, but you also will enjoy everything else the city has to offer. Attractions include wine tasting, local art, whale watching, shops and restaurants, live music, festivals and more. You also can take advantage of the free open air trolley.</p>\n  \n <h3>2. La Jolla – San Diego</h3>\n \n <p>If you are down in San Diego, consider visiting <a href=\"https://lajollabythesea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">La Jolla Shores</a> and La Jolla Cove. La Jolla Shores is a popular spot for swimming, kayaking and scuba diving. La Jolla Cove is a smaller spot which you may need to reach by kayak if the tides are high. If you snorkel, you might catch a glimpse of Garibaldi fish. You also will want to plan a stop at Torrey Pines State Beach to work on your tan. Adventurous surfers can head south to Black’s Beach.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The orange cliffs that enclose these beautiful beaches offer picturesque views—and if you are willing to walk far enough—a degree of solitude. That is hard to come by in a part of the world as crowded as Southern California.</p>\n \n <p>While you are visiting, you can also drop by nearby attractions like the Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Torrey Pines State Reserve, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, and more.</p>\n     \n <h3>3. Los Padres National Forest – Big Sur</h3>\n \n <p>Moving up the coast a ways, we come to Los Padres National Forest in the <a href=\"https://www.bigsurcalifornia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Sur</a> area of California. Specifically, we direct your attention to Kirk Creek Campground, which Recreation.gov accurately refers to as an “oceanside paradise.” With its position up on a 100-foot bluff, this campground offers you commanding views of the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The rocky beaches near Kirk Creek Campground may not be the classic sandy beaches you associate with California, but they will get you away from the crowds. You’ll appreciate the seclusion and the breathtaking scenery.</p>\n \n <p>Along with walking along the beach, you can also hike in the forest. If you have a fishing permit, you can cast a line in the hopes of catching yellow perch. Keep your eyes open for wildlife such as deer, foxes, racoons, bobcats, and even bears and mountain lions.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Making the Most of California Beaches</h2>\n \n <p>Here are a few simple recommendations that will help make your next trip to a California beach a successful one:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>Bring a <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach canopy</a>. Do not underestimate how bright and hot the sun can be at a beach in Southern California. You will be grateful for the shade offered by your canopy tent.</li>\n \n <li>Watch out for rip tides and sneaker waves. Both of these can be dangerous, especially for those who do not have a lot of experience with ocean swimming.</li>\n \n <li><a href=\"/blog/national-park-planning\">Book in advance</a> if you are camping. Campgrounds at California beaches can be quite crowded, especially near major metropolitan areas. So, the sooner you can make your reservations, the better. If you want to camp at a beach that is first-come, first-served, have a plan B ready to go.</li>\n \n <li>Walk a little bit to avoid the crowds. Even if you are visiting a crowded beach in Southern California, you may be able to escape from the throngs of people simply by walking further down the beach. The farther you are willing to walk, the more likely it is that you will be able to enjoy relative solitude.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h3>Enjoy the Classic Experience of California Beaches</h3>\n     \n <p>Now you have had a chance to check out a couple of iconic Southern California beaches as well as a beautiful campsite that is a little more off-the-beaten-track. Pack your canopy tent for shelter from the sun, and enjoy the unforgettable experience of a day of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/N-aK6JnyFmk\" target=\"_blank\">California dreamin’</a>!</p>','/img/big-sur.jpg','Beach'),('beaches-pt-3',82,'Our Favorite Beaches: Northeast Coast','Checkout part 3 of our 4 part series talking about our favorite beaches as we focus on the Northeast Coast.','Hank Murry','July 10, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n  <small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite beaches: <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-1\">Part 1: Pacific Northwest</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-2\">Part 2: California</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-3\">Part 3: Northeast Coast</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-4\">Part 4: Southeast Coast</a>.</small>\n</div>\n \n <p>When you think of the northeast coast, you might immediately picture the bustling metropolitan areas of New York City or Boston. But the Northeast coast is also famous for its gorgeous beaches.</p>\n \n <p>In this post, we will share several of our favorite beaches in this part of the US with you. But first, here are a few reasons why a visit to a Northeast coast beach should be on your bucket list.</p>\n \n <h2>Why Visit Northeast Coast Beaches?</h2>\n \n <ul>\n <li><strong>Seclusion.</strong> There are actually some un-crowded beaches in the Northeast if you know where to look for them. Indeed, some beaches are also protected parts of the coast. While that on its own may not limit crowds, it does at least restrict development, ensuring you are immersed in nature’s beauty.</li> \n \n <li><strong>… Or crowds.</strong> If you do want crowds, there are plenty of options there too! The northeast coast is home to lovely urban beaches with shops, dining and entertainment along their promenades.</li>\n \n <li><strong>History.</strong> Few parts of the US are as steeped in history as the northeast Coast. You will find lighthouses and resorts, maritime and whaling museums, and so much more to enrich your historical knowledge along the Northeast coast.</li>\n </ul>\n \n \n <h3>1. Cape Cod National Seashore – Massachusetts</h3>\n \n <p>The <a href=\"https://travel.usnews.com/Cape_Cod_MA/\" target=\"_blank\">Cape Cod National Seashore</a> is among the most famous stretches of coastline in the US. Speaking about the area, Henry David Thoreau once said, &quot;A man may stand there and put all America behind him.&quot; Because this part of the coast is protected, you can have the same experience Thoreau once did as you explore these sandy shores.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>There is a lot to do at Cape Cod! You can stroll along the beach or work on your tan, drive on the beach with an appropriate permit, or go hiking, cycling, fishing or paddling.</p>\n \n <p>Along with the area’s natural splendor, your can enjoy exploring its beautiful lighthouses.</p>\n \n <p>One thing to keep in mind is that you may not camp overnight on the Cape Cod National Seashore itself. But there are some campgrounds at nearby Wellfleet Hollow Campground and Nickerson State Park. You will need reservations to stay at either. The earlier you can book, the better.</p>\n \n <h3>2. Sand Beach, Maine</h3>\n \n <p>If you are looking for peaceful spot that feels cozy and sheltered, you could pay a visit to <a href=\"https://www.acadia.ws/sand-beach.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sand Beach</a> on the Maine coast near Bar Harbor.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Enclosed by coniferous trees and low hills, this beach offers a relaxing atmosphere and unique scenery that sets it apart from anywhere else.</p>\n \n <p>Moreover, you will be right at Acadia National Park, which the National Park Service refers to as the &quot;crown jewel of the North Atlantic coast.&quot; You will have an incredible time exploring its 158 miles of hiking trails and seeing areas like Mount Desert Island, Isle au Haut, and Schoodic Peninsula. At each of these locations, you will find many exciting highlights.</p>\n \n <p>There are four campgrounds in the park; NPS recommends that you place your reservation well in advance as they fill up fast. Incidentally, all of the campgrounds are also right along the water.</p>\n \n <h3>3. Cape May Beach – New Jersey</h3>\n \n <p>While we have focused thus far on more wilderness-oriented beaches, perhaps you are looking for a more urban experience. If so, consider heading to <a href=\"https://visitnj.org/city/cape-may\" target=\"_blank\">Cape May Beach</a> in New Jersey.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Looking to visit a beach where you will feel you have been whisked away to another time? Cape May is a charming historic resort town characterized by some of the best-preserved Victorian houses in the US. Indeed, the &quot;Cape May Historic District&quot; actually encompasses the whole city, and the city itself is a National Historic Landmark. The city refers to itself as &quot;America’s original seaside resort.&quot;</p>\n \n <p>Cape May Beach does allow you to set up a tent (unlike quite a few other popular urban beaches on the Northeast coast). You are also invited to swim.</p>\n \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/cape-may.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Cape May Lighthouse\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <p>After a day at the beach, you will find shopping and dining aplenty nearby. You also can go on a cruise, charter a boat, head out on a fishing excursion, walk the famous promenade, and book a stay in a historical Victorian B&B.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Visiting Northeast Coast Beaches</h2>\n \n <p>Before you head to a Northeast coast beach, we recommend the following:</p>\n \n <ul>\n <li>Do check the rules before you go. Some more crowded beaches on the Northeast coast prohibit bringing a tent (i.e. Coney Island beach). Some beaches have strict rules as a result of <a href=\"/blog/covid-beach-vacation-tips\">covid-19</a> as well.</li> \n \n <li>Check the weather. One day at a Northeast coast beach may be hot and sunny, another cool and rainy. Temperatures may also vary between day and night. So, make sure you are packing clothing that is appropriate for the season, and that you know what to expect. Dressing in layers may be helpful in some seasons.</li>\n \n <li>Bring a <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach canopy tent</a>. If the beach you are visiting permits it, consider packing a pop-up canopy tent. It will provide you with some welcome shade on bright, sunny days, along with shelter from the wind. With that added comfort, you will be able to spend a longer time at the beach and enjoy your visit more fully.</li>\n \n <li>Do not make assumptions about camping/lodgings. Because this is a crowded part of the country, you are less likely to find campsites on or near the beaches here than you are at beaches in some other parts of the US. Look up where the closest <a href=\"/blog/state-parks-pt-4\">east coast state parks</a> are, or make plans to stay in a resort or other lodging. If you do plan to camp, make a reservation. You are not likely to find first-come, first-served camping on the Northeast coast.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h2>Experience the Diverse Delights of Northeast Coast Beaches</h2>\n \n <p>Whether you want to stay in a historic resort and immerse yourself in crowds of beachgoers or you would rather explore a national park and relax on a secluded shore, the Northeast coast is home to beaches that will capture your imagination. Pack your canopy tent, slather on some sunscreen, and have fun!</p>','/img/jersey-shore.jpg','Beach'),('beaches-pt-4',83,'Our Favorite Beaches: Southeast Coast','Checkout part 4 of our 4 part series talking about our favorite beaches as we focus on the Southeast Coast.','Hank Murry','August 21, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n  <small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite beaches: <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-1\">Part 1: Pacific Northwest</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-2\">Part 2: California</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-3\">Part 3: Northeast Coast</a>, <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-4\">Part 4: Southeast Coast</a>.</small>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>If you are dreaming of a trip to the beach, there are some unbeatable destinations to be found throughout the southeast part of the US.

There are a lot of great surfing destinations in the Southeast where you can catch big waves.</li>\n\n<li>Amazing reefs. Some of the waters around the southeastern part of the country are renowned for their crystal clarity and their incredible marine life, making for spectacular snorkelling and scuba diving.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that you know a few reasons Southeast coast beaches are worth a visit, let’s check out some locations worth adding to your bucket list.</p>\n\n<h3>The Outer Banks, North Carolina</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.outerbanks.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Outer Banks</a> is a region of North Carolina that offers more than a hundred miles of shoreline to explore. It is an unusual destination, in that you can drive way out over the water to explore the various spits and islands comprising it—kind of like the Florida Keys.</p>\n\n<p>At the Outer Banks, you will find the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, six beautiful lighthouses, and a lot of maritime and colonial history.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that The Outer Banks is a big draw to tourists visiting North Carolina, it retains an off-the-beaten-path feel. You should find it easy to avoid crowds and to find wide open, secluded spaces to explore. It very much feels like its own private world, removed from everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of where to stay, Cape Hatteras National Seashore has three different campgrounds operated by the NPS. There are plenty of other locations where you can pitch a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">tent</a> as well. There are also hotels and resorts for those looking for indoor options.</p>\n\n<h3>Biscayne National Park, Florida Keys</h3>\n\n<p>Speaking of the Florida Keys, if you are in that area, you will want to head over to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bisc/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Biscayne National Park</a>. The majority of the park is water, rather than shoreline. It is a popular destination for boating, snorkelling, fishing, and lobstering.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>If you are into water-based activities, Biscayne National Park will feel like heaven on earth. It is an incredibly diverse location in terms of its ecologies, which are home to a magnificent range of flora and fauna, including hundreds of fish and bird species and over fifty types of crustaceans. You might also spot a crocodile in the mangroves!</p>\n\n<p>You can camp right at Biscayne National Park on Elliot Key or Boca Chita Key. There are restrooms on both islands, including showers on Elliot Key. Both areas have grills and picnic tables at the campsites. You do need to take a boat to reach either, however—you cannot drive to the campgrounds.</p>\n\n<h3>Padre Island National Seashore, Texas</h3>\n\n<p>Just southeast of <a href=\"https://www.cctexas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Corpus Christi</a>, you will come across <a href=\"https://www.myspi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Padre Island National Seashore</a> on Padre Island. You should not confuse Padre Island with South Padre Island. South Padre Island is a crowded spot popular among college students. By contrast, Padre Island National Seashore on Padre Island is a more secluded destination featuring protected tidal flats, dunes and prairies.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>You’ll be visiting what NPS calls &quot;the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier island in the world.&quot; Whether you want to go fishing, beachcombing, bird-watching or hiking, there is so much to see and do.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most exciting time to visit Padre Island National Seashore is during summer, That is when there are sometimes releases of Kemp’s ridley sea turtle hatchlings! Alas, there is no way to schedule hatchings, so you need to get lucky to be there for a release. The park’s FB page may help you time your visit to coincide.</p>\n\n<p>You can camp year-round at Padre Island National Seashore on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n\n<h2>Tips for Visiting Southeast Coast Beaches</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Check the amenities available. Some Southeast coast beaches have extensive amenities for camping like toilets, showers, etc. But others may not offer any amenities at all at primitive sites. You need to check what will be waiting for you when you arrive so you know what to bring with you.</li>\n\n<li>Figure out transportation. This may be a consideration if some of the beaches you want to visit are located on islands. Do not assume all sites can be reached with a car.</li>\n\n<li>Find out how reservations work. Depending on where you are going to camp on the beach, you may or may not need a reservation. There are some beaches that do not accept reservations at all. For those sites, you need to show up early and have a plan B in case all the sites are already full. For those where you can book in advance, doing so can help ensure you will have somewhere to set up your tent.</li> \n\n<li>Pack a <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach canopy tent</a>. Along with your camping tent, a beach canopy tent makes a great supply for your visits to Southeast coast beaches. You can store your gear under the canopy tent, or set up a table and chairs underneath. If you will not be camping overnight, a canopy can offer you shelter from sun and wind during a day trip as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Enjoy All that Southeast Coast Beaches Have to Offer</h2>\n\n<p>Along the Southeast coast, you can find numerous beautiful beaches. Explore island chains, snorkel and scuba dive around reefs in clear waters, and visit picturesque lighthouses and charming beach towns. The delights of destinations like Padre Island National Seashore, The Outer Banks and Biscayne National Park are endless.</p>','/img/outer-banks-beach.jpg','Beach'),('best-affordable-tent-for-hot-weather',56,'Best Affordable Tent For Hot Weather','Looking for an inexpensive hot weather tent? Check out our recommendation.','Greg Lombardo','May 1, 2020','<p>If you have ever camped in a stifling tent in hot weather, you know but not just any tent is suitable for hot climates.</p>\n\n<p>The wrong tent can trap heat, making you more uncomfortable inside your tent than out of it, and also potentially leading to problems with dehydration or even (in extreme scenarios) putting in danger of heatstroke if you do not step outside.</p>\n\n<p>That is why it is important to shop for a tent which is suitable for hot climates. In this guide, we will introduce you to our recommended best tent for hot weather, the affordable Coleman Sundome Tent.</p>\n\n<p>But first, let&apos;s quickly discuss a few features to look for in a tent which is safe and appropriate for hot weather.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Considerations for a Hot Weather Tent</h3>\n\n<p>A hot weather tent should provide you with shade and shelter from the elements, but it should also be breathable and permit ample airflow with the outdoors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/affordable-hot-weather-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Tent in forrest with sun in background\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>That means that the materials and overall construction of the tent should be considered. You also should avoid tents which are made out of particularly dark fabrics which absorb light instead of reflecting it.</p>\n\n<h3>Our Recommended Best Tent for Hot Weather: The Coleman Sundome Tent</h3>\n	\n<p>We have tested a number of hot weather tents, but the one we have been most satisfied with is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3d7P3Xb\" target=\"_blank\">Coleman Sundome Tent</a>. This tent is made out of polyester taffeta 75 denier flysheet. This denier rating is reasonably sturdy, but not too thick, helping the tent to stay breathable.</p>\n\n<p>It takes only about 10 minutes to set up this tent even if you have no help. With two people working, you could probably get it set up faster. What is cool about this tent (literally) is its design, which incorporates two components: the tent itself and a rainfly.</p>\n\n<p>The tent features a combination of ground vents and large, mesh windows. The purpose of the vents is to let warm air from the bottom of the tent out instead of a allowing it to rise and get trapped in the tent. Meanwhile, the large, mesh windows permit plenty of open airflow, and would do a good job circulating air even without the vents.</p>\n\n<p>The rain fly goes over top of this main tent component. Since the rain fly is a separate item, it is possible to leave the large windows (which are actually a bit more like panels than “windows” per se) open to stay cool, but still have full coverage from any precipitation. The rain fly is shaped with a hood which goes over top of the entrance to the tent, giving you a little sheltered threshold where you can remove wet shoes or boots and avoid trailing water or mud inside your dry tent.</p>\n\n<p>This tent is engineered with the WeatherTec System which includes covered seams and welded corners. These additional features further enhance the water-resistance of the tent. Also, the frame is sturdily designed, capable of standing up to winds in excess of 35 mph.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that you do not have to use the rain fly if you do not want to. If you decide not to set it up, the mesh panels will give you a layer of partial shade, but otherwise allow even freer airflow. You also will be able to enjoy looking out on the scenery in all its splendour.</p>\n\n<p>The design features discussed above would have been more than enough for us to give a strong recommendation for this tent as an affordable hot weather option. But the tent includes other great features as well, further adding to its value.</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, the walls of the tent include built-in mesh pockets. In these, you can store some of your small accessories, keeping them handy and organized. For another, the tent includes an E-Port. You can pull an extension cord through this port, providing you with a power supply which you can use to charge and run your devices while you are camping.</p>\n\n<p>As far as options go, you can select from four different sizes. The smallest tent has enough room for two people to sleep comfortably. The largest one can accommodate up to six people. There are two color commendations available. One of them is a combination of navy and light gray, while the other is light green and white. The cooler of the two color combinations is the white and light green one, because these colors reflect more sunlight. But the light gray and navy one is more of a mid-tone color combination than two really dark colors, and doesn’t absorb too much light or heat.</p>\n\n<p>As far as taking this tent down goes, that only took a few minutes longer than getting it set up. The second time, setup and takedown were even faster and easier. The trickiest part was getting it into its bag. But if you fold it in half lengthwise, and then fold it into thirds (kind of like you are folding shirts Marie Kondo style), you can make it pretty compact. From there, you can just roll it up. You can do the same thing with the rain fly, and they should both fit inside the bag without any problems.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any drawbacks with this tent? The only thing which we noticed is that the zippers didn’t seem like the strongest, but neither did they seem weak and brittle. So long as you are reasonably careful with them, they should hold up just fine.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion: The Coleman Sundome Tent is the Breathable, Comfortable Hot Weather Tent You Need</h3>\n\n<p>The Coleman Sundome Tent is a sturdy, well-made tent with a smart design which maximizes shade, ventilation, rain protection, and overall versatility. The combination of the mesh panels on the tent and the rain fly gives you a “best of both worlds” solution for airflow and shelter, allowing you to camp comfortably in hot climates like at <a href=\"/blog/best-tent-for-burning-man\">Buring Man</a> for example. Whether it is bright and sunny or pouring rain, you will remain dry and cool in your tent.</p>','/img/sun-behind-leaf.jpg','Best,Camping'),('best-beach-canopy',4,'Best canopy tent for the beach','Sometimes we love the sunshine a little too much. Just ask our bright red shoulders.','Kenneth Huebsch','June 4, 2017','<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>Normally we like straight-legged cross-truss canopy tent frames because they are durable and can be erected directly next to another straight-legged canopy tent. This makes them ideal for outdoor festivals. Whenever the wind begins to blow these canopy tents will stand strong without any give. The drawback to straight-legged cross-truss shelters is that they can get heavy and are expensive. For beach use, these traits are not as important and we have come across a cheaper, lighter weight option that outperforms our traditional recommendations at the beach. The canopy tent industry is not as popular as many other industries and there isn’t universally accepted terminology yet. So there is no exact name for this style of shelter. They typically use the names Sun Shelter, Beach Tent, or Shade Tent, though. Basically we are referring to the new canopy tent design that uses flexible tent poles instead of rigid aluminum fixed frames. The tent poles are usually fiberglass instead so the entire shelter often weighs less than 10 lbs. These canopy tents look more like tents than traditional Pop-Up canopy tents.</p>\n\n<p>In addition the portability, we also like how resistant to the wind the <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">best beach canopy</a> is. They behave similarly to a tent in windy situations, which often happens at the beach. The shelter blows around and flexes, but as long as it is secured to the ground it can withstand strong wind.</p>\n\n<h2>Sidewalls</h2>\n<p>The sun moves across the sky and early or late in the day the sun may be very low on the horizon. Since UV protection is our top priority, we want to be able to protect ourselves from sun that is not directly overhead. We also don’t want to have to keep moving our sitting positions to remain in the shadow of the canopy. If you are shopping for a traditional canopy tent you should look for one that includes a sidewall or consider purchasing a sidewall if one isn’t included. Many of the new sun shelters already have a sidewall built into one side. We think this is a valuable trait of a canopy tent that will be used on the beach.</p>\n\n<h2>Anchors</h2>\n<p>It is important to have the correct type of stakes whenever you will be setting up your canopy tent at the beach. Most of the time the stakes that are included with canopy tents are thin flimsy aluminum stakes. These stakes don’t stick in sand and your canopy tent may be susceptible to damage from a strong gust of wind. A canopy tent that is blowing in the wind is dangerous to people around it, so you should always make sure that it is strongly anchored to the ground. Although the sun shelters that we have reviewed include thicker plastic stakes, we think that it is worth it to spend the money to purchase threaded stakes. We like a product called the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2qVHFFR\">Orange Screw</a> and think that it is the best stake to use in the sand.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Recommendation</h2>\n<p>We always like to remind our readers that there is no \"best\" canopy tent because everybody’s use case is different. Each person must decide which canopy tent is best for them based on the situations that they will be using their shelters in. I wanted to show you my favorite, though, so that you can have a starting point for your search. I think that the new sun shelter designs are perfect for beach use because they are lightweight and resistant to wind. I like the shelters that have a sidewall pre built into the design and I don’t like the shelter’s whose canopy fabric doesn’t have a UPF 50+ rating. Based on my testing I think that Lightspeed Outdoors currently manufactures the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2sttPMN\">Best Canopy Tent For The Beach</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that our recommendation might not be the best for you. Maybe you want to be able to use your canopy tent in more environments than just the beach. If you want the flexibility to use your canopy tent at a craft fair, then the beach sun shelters won’t be appropriate. So as you shop, just remember that if you plan on using your canopy tent at the beach the things you should look for are UV protection and the ability to anchor into sand. Best of luck, and don’t get sunburnt!</p>','/img/beach-sun-shelter.png','Best,Beach'),('best-canopy-tent-for-barbeque',7,'Best canopy tent for your barbeque','Chicken and burgers taste better when you can sit back in the shade.','Kenneth Huebsch','August 11, 2017','<p>Hosting a barbeque?

Let us share our favorite under $100 with you!','Bryan Connolly','May 26, 2020','<p>As you are <a href=\"/\">shopping for a canopy tent</a>, you will notice that there are a number of price brackets. While many canopy tents sell for more than $100, you will also find some budget canopy tents which you can purchase for less than that amount. But are any tents in that low price range worth it?</p>\n\n<p>The answer to that question is, &quot;yes.&quot; In this article, we will share our top recommendation for a budget canopy tent under $100. But first, let&apos;s talk about some important considerations when you are buying a canopy tent on a budget.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Considerations When Shopping for a Canopy Tent on a Budget</h3>\n\n<p>When shopping for a budget canopy tent, you should pay extra attention to the quality of the construction and how sturdy the materials are. It is common for manufacturers to cut corners in these areas to produce a less expensive product, but you can find durable tents in this price range if you do your research.</p>\n\n<p>The next thing to know is that for under $100, you probably will not find a lot of extra <a href=\"/blog/canopy-tent-accessories\">bells and whistles</a>. But you may still find some special features such as adjustability.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you should always consider the dimensions you need for your intended use, as well as where you will set up the tent and in what conditions you plan to use it.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to be setting up on the beach, for example, the strength of the materials will matter more than if you will be setting up in a less breezy location. Plus, sea breezes bring sea spray, so you might want to choose a tent with metal parts which are not likely to rust.</p>\n\n<h4>Our Recommended Canopy Tent for Under $100: Ohuhu EZ Pop-Up Slant Leg Canopy Tent</h4>\n\n<p>Now that we&apos;ve talked a bit about key considerations when shopping for a canopy tent for under $100, let’s explore our recommended product in its price range, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cchsut\" target=\"_blank\">Ohuhu EZ Pop-Up Slant Leg Canopy Tent</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/ohuhu-ez-pop-up-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Ohuhu EZ Pop Up Canopy Tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>This canopy tent measures 10&apos;x10&apos; at the base and 8&apos;x8&apos; at the top. So, the legs tilt inwards towards the top, providing some extra stability. These dimensions make it about the right size for up to four or five people to sit underneath at a time. It is also large enough that you could fit a small table under it.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of appearance, it is basic-looking, and comes in a bright blue color. This gives it a kind of &quot;beachy&quot; vibe, but it is suitable for everything from a backyard barbecue to setting up at a farmer’s market.</p>\n\n<p>With two people working together, we were able to set up this tent in around 9 minutes on our first try, and around 8 minutes on our second. Can one person handle the job by themselves? The answer to this question is &quot;yes,&quot; but it is certainly easier for two people. Still, with a bit of practice, you should be able to set up this tent on your own if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is to unfold the <a href=\"/blog/cross-truss-vs-pyramid\">frame</a>. After that, you use the Velcro straps at the corners to secure the canopy. You can then take advantage of one of the nice extra features which this tent includes, which is the ability to adjust the height using the buttons on the legs. We are happy to report that you won’t pinch your fingers locking the legs with these buttons. This is a definite advantage over a lot of competing products, which are notorious for doing just that. Available height options include 90\", 94.4\" and 98.4.&quot;</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/ohuhu-setup.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Ohuhu Setup\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Despite the affordable price of the Ohuhu EZ Pop-Up Slant Leg Canopy Tent, the design utilizes robust materials. The frame is made out of powder-coated stainless steel which is strong and can resist corrosion, making it appropriate for the beach. The 300D Polyester used for the canopy is sturdy and resists tears. It also features a silver coating for UV50+ protection, making a great <a href=\"/blog/best-affordable-tent-for-hot-weather\">affordable tent for hot weather</a>. That level of UV safeguarding prevents 99% of harmful rays from reaching you when you are under the canopy’s shade. Keep in mind that sun can still hit you through the sides of a canopy tent, however, and you should still wear sunscreen.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/ohuhu-family.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Family sitting under Ohuhu sun shelter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>While flame resistant to the CPAI-84 standard, this tent does not feature waterproofing. So, you should not use it when it is raining hard, though it may help keep you dry if there is a light shower. Also, you should note that there are no vents in the canopy. That means that it may be prone to billowing in strong winds or gusts. So, it also is not ideal for especially breezy days.</p>\n\n<p>Putting away the tent is also fast and easy, just like setting it up. When it is collapsed into its compact form, it measures only 4.1’ x 0.65’ x 0.65.’ A carrying case with wheels is included with your purchase. So, transporting it to and from the site is easy, even for just one person. Since the legs are durable steel instead of a lighter metal, the tent is a little heavy. But the wheels reduce the amount of carrying you need to deal with, so this should not be problematic.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion: The Ohuhu EZ Pop-Up Slant Leg Canopy Tent is a High-Quality Tent at a Reasonable Price</h3>\n\n<p>You have now had a chance to learn all about the Ohuhu EZ Pop-Up Slant Leg Canopy Tent. The biggest detractor for this tent is the lack of vents in the canopy. There are also not a lot of extra features, but this is expected given the low price point.</p>\n\n<p>These minor drawbacks are greatly outweighed by the advantages of the tent, which include protection from harmful UV rays, sturdy materials which can withstand a lot of wear and tear, adjustable heights, and fast and easy setup and take-down. The carrying case with wheels adds extra convenience. All told, you are getting an excellent value when you purchase the Ohuhu EZ Pop-Up Slant Leg Canopy Tent for under $100.</p>','/img/texture.jpg','Best'),('best-college-footbal-tailgating',70,'Top 14 College Football Tailgating Schools','Here is our list of the top 14 schools for college football tailgating.','Ben Lullus','November 26, 2021','<p>For college football fans, the game itself will always be the main event. But the tailgate party doesn’t have to be far behind. What are the best schools for tailgating? At any of the following schools, you’ll have tailgating experiences you will never forget.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Penn State</h3>\n\n<p>Tailgating at Penn State is such a big deal that there is actually a name for the tent city that shows up before games at the Beaver Stadium. It used to be called \"Paternoville,\" and is now known as \"Nittanyville.\" Fans may party for days before a game takes place. While you are hanging out there, you might even be lucky enough to catch an unexpected performance by the marching band.</p>\n\n<h3>2. South Carolina</h3>\n\n<p>If ambiance is what you are after, the University of South Carolina offers one of the most unique and exciting locations for tailgating. You’ll be able to party at the Cockaboose Railroad, where you can rent a decommissioned caboose. There are 22 of them in all, each of them converted into a luxury unit with a flatscreen TV and other incredible amenities.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Harvard</h3>\n\n<p>Another distinctive tailgate experience is Harvard. Here you can skip the typical brats and burgers. Instead, you can enjoy fine cheeses and wines, most likely served with real dishware. But don’t let that fool you—Harvard fans aren’t delicate, and they know how to party hard.</p>\n\n<h3>4. University of Washington</h3>\n\n<p>Show up to support the Washington Huskies, and you can go beyond regular tailgating to instead try \"sailgating!\" This is exactly what it sounds like—tailgating in a boat. If you do not have a boat of your own, you can pay to go out on someone else’s. While you are on the water, you can indulge in delicious seafood.</p>\n\n<h3>5. UCLA</h3>\n\n<p>The best time to show up for a tailgate party at UCLA is of course for the Rose Bowl. But if you cannot make it out for that, it is still worth it to try and catch at least one UCLA tailgating experience. The weather is gorgeous, and the party scene is intense.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Louisiana State University</h3>\n\n<p>For another tailgating experience that is distinctly regional in nature, you’ll want to party at LSU. Where else can you enjoy jambalaya while you are supporting your favorite college football team?</p>\n\n<h3>7. University of Texas at Austin</h3>\n\n<p>The Texas Memorial Stadium is the site of massive tailgating parties in support of the Longhorns—but it is not the only spot where you can head to party before Longhorns games. Also popular are Bevo Blvd. and Scholz Garden. One thing is sure—wherever you decide to head to tailgate, you’ll be able to eat plenty of Texas barbecue surrounded by die-hard Longhorns fans.</p>\n\n<h3>8. West Virginia University</h3>\n\n<p>You might not expect it, but West Virginia University is where some of the country’s craziest tailgating parties take place. So, if you want to party with fans that go absolutely wild, this is where to do it.</p>\n\n<h3>9. University of Wisconsin-Madison</h3>\n\n<p>When it comes to states that are absolutely obsessed with college football, few can match Wisconsin, where just about everyone you meet has some loyalty to the Badgers.</p>\n\n<p>So, if possible, you are going to want to go to a tailgating party while you are in the area. Not only will you be surrounded by friendly, enthusiastic fans, but you’ll also get to indulge in some of the most delicious fried food on the planet, plus plenty of cheese and beer.</p>\n\n<h3>10. University of Tennessee</h3>\n\n<p>You wouldn’t think Tennessee of all places would be a location where sailgating would take off, would you? Nonetheless, it is a big deal here, thanks to the Tennessee River. Collectively, the fans that party on the river are known as the \"Vol Navy.\"</p>\n\n<h3>11. West Point</h3>\n\n<p>There are three places you can tailgate for West Point games: the South Dock, Daly Field, and Buffalo Soldier Field. While the party itself is worth the trip, make sure you don’t miss out on a walking tour of the West Point Museum. And if you are looking for luxury, book the stadium’s Tailgate Suite.</p>\n\n<h3>12. Florida State</h3>\n\n<p>As with tailgating at UCLA, tailgating at Florida State is a great experience in part because of the warm, sunny weather. You’ll have a blast here partying here—just make sure you don’t forget to bring plenty of sunscreen and shade. </p>\n\n<h3>13. University of Oregon</h3>\n\n<p>Come to the University of Oregon to support the Oregon Ducks at Autzen Stadium. Tailgating spots to check out include Mo Tailgate Center, East Stadium Lot and Essig Field. Don your green and yellow, and enjoy mingling with the Ducks’ friendly fans.</p>\n\n<h3>14. Notre Dame</h3>\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise that another top destination for tailgating is Notre Dame. While you’re partying, you’ll have a chance to take in the school’s pre-game traditions, like the march out by the Band of the Fighting Irish, the marching band’s concert, and the player walk.</p>\n <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/notre-dame-stadium.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Tailgating at Notre Dame\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<h2>Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your College Football Tailgate Experience</h2>\n\n<p>Now you know the best schools for college football tailgating!

This type of tent can be adjusted to accommodate the angle of the sun and to let in the breeze or screen it out depending on your needs.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will be comparing and contrasting three <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">portable beach canopy</a> sun shelters to help you identify the best purchase for 2019. Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.otentik.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Otentik Beach Sunshade</a></h3>\n<p>This product is promoted as &ldquo;The Original Sunshade Since 2011.&rdquo;&nbsp; It comes in three sizes (large, medium, and small) and is supported by sandbags for stability. There are 26 different colors available, so you can pick an option that expresses your personality.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A single person can get this tent set up inside about ten minutes.</li>\n<li>The bags can accommodate a lot of sand, and the tent can be stretched quite a bit. This provides for excellent stability even in strong wind.</li>\n<li>When you collapse the canopy to carry it or store it, it is fairly compact. The fabric is not bulky, though it is sturdy.</li>\n<li>This tent provides fantastic sun protection.</li>\n<li>Construction is excellent all around. As an example, if you look at the sandbags carefully, you will notice that a cover stitch has been employed. This type of stitch holds up well even when you stretch the fabric. This increases the tent&rsquo;s overall longevity.</li>\n<li>Otentik provides responsive, knowledgeable customer service in case of questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tent can be a bit heavy to lug around owing to the steel poles. These also have the potential to rust with time. Aluminum would be preferable.</li>\n<li>When you are ready to pack up and head home, you may have some hassles dealing with the tent. Collapsing it is easy, but folding it up nicely takes some effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Verdict: The Otentik Beach Sunshade is a fabulous choice if you are looking for a rugged sun shelter which can stand up to heavy wind and frequent use. While it has a couple of drawbacks, they are pretty minor when you consider the solid manufacturing which has gone into this product.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://sombra-shade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sombra Sun Shade</a></h3>\n<p>This shelter appears similar to the Otentik Beach Sunshade at a glance. On the product page, it claims that you can set it up in just two minutes. Does it live up to this claim? Let&rsquo;s take a look at the pros and cons.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Lycra fabric used in this sun shade provides great sun protection.</li>\n<li>When you collapse the tent, it is lightweight and compact, making it easy to transport to and from your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This tent doesn&rsquo;t provide you with a whole lot of headroom. In fact, depending on your height, you may find that it isn&rsquo;t even comfortable to sit under. If you are planning on lying down on the beach, however, it may fit your needs.</li>\n<li>While the tent is pretty easy to put up if there is no wind, it can be challenging to erect if there is.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Verdict: While the Sombra Sun Shade might serve your needs in select situations, on the whole, comparisons to the Otentik Beach Sunshade are superficial. The overall design concept is the same, but it is much better executed by Otentik.</p>\n<p>Otentik&rsquo;s product is sturdier and manufactured with far greater quality than Sombra&rsquo;s. The dimensions of the Otentik tent also make it a more versatile choice to accommodate your activities at the beach.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nesotents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neso Tents Beach Canopy</a></h3>\n<p>The Neso Tents Beach Tent shares the same basic design as the Sombra and Otentik tents, but is only available in one size: 7&rsquo; x 7&rsquo;. You can purchase it in a few different colors and patterns. Like many other sun tents, it is designed to block out 98% of harmful UV rays.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The poles are made of aluminum, which means that they are rust-resistant and lightweight. Carrying this tent is incredibly easy.</li>\n<li>The Neso Tents Beach Tent features sturdy materials and is able to stand up to high winds.</li>\n<li>The sandbags stretch, so you can fill them up with enough sand to keep your tent well-anchored.</li>\n<li>The materials and construction are not bad overall, but the stitches are not as durable as those on the Otentik. This means that if the tent is going to be subjected to a lot of wind (or other wear and tear), its condition may deteriorate faster than you would like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can be challenging to set up the tent in high wind conditions.</li>\n<li>The size of the tent needs to be considered with care before making a purchase. For relatively uncrowded conditions, the size should not be a problem, but it may be if you are going to be packed in tight with a lot of other beachgoers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Verdict:</p>\n<p>Like the Sombra, the Neso is lightweight and easy to transport. It is however higher in quality and better designed from a spatial standpoint. The Otentik however is better engineered in terms of stitch quality and overall durability.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n		<img src=\"/img/beach-canopy-umbrellas.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Umbrellas on beach\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Overall Best Choice: Otentik Beach Sunshade</h3>\n<p>It is pretty easy to rank these three portable canopy sun shelters in terms of quality. The Sombra Sun Shade is the clear loser. While it has the advantage of being lightweight and compact, it shares this benefit with the Neso Tents Beach Tent. The Neso is in all other respects a superior option.</p>\n<p>But the Neso is outstripped by the Otentik Beach Sunshade when it comes to resilience&mdash;and obviously that makes it a contender for first place.</p>\n<p>So which of these two tents should you purchase? The best thing to do is evaluate your needs. If you really want a lightweight option, go with the Neso Tents Beach Tent. If you find yourself wanting something a little different, check out our blog post on the <a href=\"/blog/types-of-sun-shelters\">pros and cons of different types of beach shade</a> to determine which might fit your lifestyle the best.</p>\n<p>But if you want a tent that will stand the test of time, it is worth sacrificing a little convenience in the portability department. We feel that products should be built to last, so our vote for the best portable canopy sun shelter for 2019 is the Otentik Beach Sunshade.</p>','/img/boat-on-beach.jpg','Best'),('best-tailgating-canopy',9,'Best canopy tent for tailgating','We did the research and picked out the best canopy tent for your upcoming tailgate.','Eric Schroeder','August 21, 2017','<p>It’s been a long 197 days since the \'big game\'. We’ve had to endure long seasons of basketball, baseball, golf, soccer, you name the sport; each one filling out a less-than-exciting ESPN highlight reel for past six months. I’m not one to wish summer away, but as we approach the end of August and kids head back to school an excitement starts to fill college campuses and cities around the country. I’m reminded that September is just around the corner, which can only mean one thing. In just 20 short days our Saturdays and Sundays will be filled with endless hours of uninterrupted football and Monday SportsCenter will once again be worth watching. Yelling at our favorite teams for goal line fumbles, and rejoicing on the unexpected 80 yard touchdown run or catch. While most of us will enjoy the games from the comfort of our own homes, the committed fans will be heading out to the stadiums to watch all the excitement. And as diehard fans know, there is one thing that is a quintessential part of every game day. Tailgating. Burgers and hot dogs on the grill, finger foods lined up on tables, coolers filled with beverages, yard games strewn across the parking lots. It’s the party before the party. Friends and family gathered to celebrate their team and inviting friendly banter with opposing fans. While some might think it’s easy to prepare for the ultimate tailgate, there is one particular item on the tailgating checklist that we want to focus on. We describe it as the most important part of every tailgate, the canopy tent. In fact, we’re not even sure you can call your tailgate a tailgate without one. With all the things to worry about in the days leading up to the big tailgate, we know time is limited and valuable. Our goal is to present information in a way that you can quickly decide which shelter is the <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com\">best pop up canopy tent for tailgating</a>. We’ve spent countless hours scouring the internet and local sports stores, purchasing as many different instant shelters that we could find so that you can focus on other aspects of your tailgate.</p>\n\n<p>You might ask, well why do I need a pop-up canopy tent for my tailgate? Great question. First, we believe an instant shelter is the most effective insurance policy that can protect your tailgate from inclement weather. Weather can be unpredictable and change in an instant when outdoors for an entire day, especially during the Fall months. Southern states typically have more rainfall than northern states during this season, but any sunny day can quickly change to overcast and rain. As the season progresses and temperatures drop, rain can turn a gorgeous Fall day into a cold and miserable one. Tailgates typically range from 3-10 hours depending on game time. If you’re exposed to the elements and it begins to rain that’s a long time sitting around in wet clothes, and the game hasn’t even started yet. Not to mention the food. All that time grilling and prepping is now in jeopardy of being wasted. Instant pop-up shelters have become increasingly affordable over the years and competition has spurred technological upgrades that greatly enhance their ease of use. An insurance policy for between $100 and $200 can give you piece of mind in knowing that your food, friends and family are protected from the elements. Second, protect yourself from the sun. September is only one month removed from August, typically the hottest month of the year. Especially for southern states and SEC games, temperatures can be in the 80’s and 90’s the first few weeks of the football season. Spending hours in the sun can cause dehydration, sun burn, and exhaustion. Sun Shelters can provide needed relief from the sun and allow your body temperature to cool. Place your chair underneath and kick your feet up, tailgating is supposed to be fun and relaxing! Lastly, an often overlooked benefit of having a canopy tent at your tailgate is that they provide a physical boundary to your tailgate. Vehicles are often packed into tailgate parking lots as tightly as possible. With cars a few feet on both sides, you’ll need to maximize the small space that you get. Having a pop-up canopy tent at your tailgate will prevent your neighbors next door from intruding on your real estate. Space is tight, maximize it and protect it. The best canopy tent for tailgating will provide all these things.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1\">\n            <img src=\"/img/miss-tailgate.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Canopy tents at Ole-Miss Tailgate\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now that we’ve established that an instant canopy tent is necessary for your tailgate let’s talk about what to look for when purchasing one. When we review and recommend pop-up canopy tents, we’re often looking at four components: affordability, durability, portability and ease of use. For the purpose of tailgating we find two of these components critical. Affordability is important as we’re always trying to find value in an instant shelter. The most expensive tents don’t always provide the best value. There are plenty out there that are expensive but we don’t necessarily need all the features they offer. When it comes to affordability we’re looking for a unique mix of expected value and an affordable price target. The second thing we’ll want to look for is durability. For tailgating purposes, we find this as the most important component. Depending on use, we’ve found the lifetime of a sun shelter typically ranges from 3-7 years. A key component to durability is the engineering of the structure. We have found that canopies with full truss cross systems greatly outlive their counterparts with only perimeter trusses. The full truss cross system has a cross section of support through the center of the canopy which is far less vulnerable to pressure on the sides or rotational pressure.  We think investing in a quality instant canopy tent will pay dividends in your tailgating experience for years to come. Since it’s likely to be set up within a few feet of your vehicle, we’re not going to talk much about portability. Often we see durability compromised for portability so it’s a component we don’t see relevant for tailgating.</p>\n\n<p>We have reviewed and researched almost every canopy tent on the market today. We feel there is one specific tent that we can recommend as the best canopy tent for any tailgate. The <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2vXT3VP\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eurmax Basic 10’ x 10’ Pop Up Tent</a> surpasses all of our requirements to be an outstanding canopy tent. Eurmax is a brand many people might not be familiar with, but they have been specializing for years in manufacturing commercial grade canopy tents. As we mentioned durability being the most important attribute for our tailgating canopy tent, we found this full truss cross system tent to provide unmatched stability and sturdiness. The hammertone powder coated finish on the high grade steel frame gives it a heavy duty commercial feel. There’s no need to worry about a crowded tailgate with people bumping into the telescoping legs. As far as commercial grade canopy tents go, this tent by far is the most affordable. It delivers exceptional value given all of the features included. The thumb-lock-slider buttons allow for easy set up and tear down of the telescoping legs and canopy lock mechanisms. No need to fuss with metal stoppers and pinched fingers. The canopy provides a maximum peak height of 11.1 ft which is the tallest canopy we have reviewed so even the tallest of friends and family will be comfortable. A useful Velcro strip along the length of the valence provides an easy attachment for a side wall if you want to block out those pesky rival fans next to you. We would recommend using the provided stakes to anchor the legs, however the included guy ropes are difficult to use in a tailgating environment. With a lot of foot traffic in a small space guy ropes generally do not work well. If wind is in the weather forecast we recommend purchasing weighted bags or plates as an additional anchor to the stakes. All of these just touch the surface of what this canopy tent is all about. The bottom line is if you’re looking for the best tailgating canopy tent stop looking and get this one.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to look like a real tailgate veteran, you’ll want to mark your tailgate spot with a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2vYzI6M\" rel=\"nofollow\">tailgate flag</a>. We all know how difficult it is to find a friends tailgate. We recommend placing a collapsible 20’ tailgate pole next to your canopy tent and attached a flag of your choosing. Make it something that will stand out from other flags, your friends will appreciate it! Overall, we couldn’t be more excited that football and tailgating season is almost here. Spending a Saturday or Sunday outdoors with friends, family, and fans are something everyone can enjoy. There’s an electricity about the tailgating atmosphere that is contagious. We hope this informative buying guide gives some clarity about what to look for when trying to find the best canopy tent tailgating. Enjoy those burgers, hot dogs, and beverages.

Then, we&apos;ll share our favorite recommended tent for Burning Man with you and explain the features which will help protect you from the elements.</p>\n\n<h3>What to Expect from the Weather at Burning Man</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://burningman.org/event/preparation/playa-living/weather/\" target=\"_blank\">official website for Burning Man</a> says, \"Weather on the playa is often violent and unpredictable. Dust storms, high winds, freezing temperatures, <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">rain</a>, we get it all out there. It’s impossible to be overly prepared when it comes to the elements.\"</p>\n\n<p>You will be in the Black Rock Desert in Gerlach in northwest Nevada. During the week that Burning Man takes place, average daytime highs reach around 88°F and average lows dip to a round 52°F. It is possible for the lows to drop down into the 30s and for the highs to crest above 100°F.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/people-at-burning-man.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"4 People at Burning Man\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The good news is that the official website for Burning Man seems to exaggerate the potential highs and lows, probably to help you stay on the safe side.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, it doesn&apos;t appear that temperatures ever have actually dropped below freezing during the festival. Also, most of the time, you can expect temperatures to stay below 100°F, unless there is a severe heat wave the year that you attend.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, 88°F under a tent can feel like it is baking hot if you do not have a tent which is well-ventilated. Likewise, if the temperature is down in the 50s or even below, you can feel pretty cold if you are not well-prepared.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, high winds, rain, and dust are all possibilities that you might have to contend with. So, you&apos;re going to need a tent which can protect you from all three.</p>\n\n<h3>Our Recommended Best Tent for Burning Man: Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room | Evanston Camping Tent with Screened-In Porch</h3>\n	\n<p>Taking into account everything we have discussed above regarding possible weather conditions at Burning Man, our recommended tent for the event is the Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room.</p>\n\n<p>Made out of <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">polyester taffeta 75D</a>, it is the sturdy, breathable tent you need to be comfortable in a wide range of desert conditions. It is available in two configurations. One of them is large enough for six people, while the other is big enough for eight people. In fact, you can get up to two queen-sized air beds inside comfortably even if you go with the smaller configuration. At its center, the height of the tent is 5 feet and 8 inches. That means that many occupants would be able to stand fully upright inside.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/coleman-dome-tent-with-screen-room.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Best Tent For Burning Man\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The construction of the tent includes protective seams and patented corner welds as part of the proprietary WeatherTec system. These features prevent water from seeping through the needle holes in the seams and ensure that both the floor and the walls of the tent are waterproof. The zipper to the door also is water-resistant thanks to the fabric of the cuff. All of these features also help to keep desert dust out of your tent.</p>\n\n<p>So, hopefully you will not need to deal with rain during your Burning Man stay, but if you do, this tent will keep you dry. And if there are any high desert winds, the responsive design of the frame with its guy-out triangles and sturdy poles will be rugged enough to stand up to gusts while also keeping the interior comfortable.</p>\n\n<p>As for coping with the heat, there are a few features which make the Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room a good option. First of all, the tent colors are white and green, neither of which traps heat the same way that a darker color would (one thing you do not want at Burning Man is a black tent).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the tent incorporates extended window awnings into its design. With these, you can open your windows to allow a cross-breeze while enjoying some extra protection from sunlight or precipitation from the extended awnings.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-xs-offset-3 col-md-offset-4\">\n		<img src=\"/img/coleman-dome-tent-window-awnings.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Coleman Dome Tent window awnings\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Hopefully, opening your windows will allow you to be comfortable in the interior of your tent even at midday. But if you still need to cool down more, you can sit in the screen room in front. There, ventilation is maximized, but insects can&apos;t get at you. There is even enough room in that area of the tent to sleep if you want to take a nap during the day (at night, you should be plenty cool inside the main section of the tent).</p>\n\n<p>To help you stay organized, the tent includes storage pockets which are built into the walls. With their mesh design, you can easily see what you have stashed inside each of them.</p>\n\n<p>One more advantage which makes this tent a good fit for Burning Man is its fast and easy setup features, including Insta-Clip pole attachments and continuous pole sleeves which resist snagging. It shouldn&apos;t take you more than 15 minutes to set up your tent after you learn how. So, not only can you set up initially quickly, but if you decide to relocate your tent at any point during the event, you can do so rapidly.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion: The Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room is the Sturdy, Well-Ventilated, Water-Resistant Tent You Need for Burning Man</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to have a good time at Burning Man, you need to be prepared for the wide temperature range between day and night as well as the possibility of dust and rainstorms in the desert.</p>\n\n<p>With the Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room, you have a spacious, rugged tent with multiple waterproofing features, resilience against wind, and excellent ventilation. With its fast setup process and its reasonable price, it is the ideal tent for your Burning Man adventures.</p>','/img/burning-man-aerial.jpg','Best'),('best-tent-for-stargazing',59,'Best Tent For Stargazing','It\'s lovely to be able to fall asleep with a view of the stars.

So, you will need to select a backpacking tent. Which tent is the best for your backpacking stargazing adventure? In this article, we will introduce you to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3k5P3uY\" target=\"_blank\">our recommended option</a>. But first, let&apos;s talk about a few basic features to look for when you are picking out a tent for stargazing.</p>\n\n<h4>What to Look for in the Best Tent for Stargazing</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lightweight.</strong> To find the best spot to set up away from light pollution with a clear, open view of the sky, you may need to do significant backpacking. For that reason, you should choose a tent which is lightweight and comfortable to carry.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Roomy.</strong> You will need a tent which is spacious as well, because you will need to accommodate yourself, anybody else you&apos;ll have with you, and your equipment.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Storage pockets.</strong> Speaking of storing equipment, you may also find it helpful to choose a tent which includes pockets for smaller supplies.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Mesh windows.</strong> Mesh can keep insects out while still offering you a view of the stars even from within your tent. They also can boost ventilation. </li>\n\n<h4>Our Recommended Tent for Stargazing: The Kelty Salida Camping and Backpacking Tent</h4>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now you know what to look for when you are picking out a tent to go stargazing. Let&apos;s take an in-depth look at our suggested tent for stargazing, the Kelty Salida Camping and Backpacking Tent.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3k5P3uY\" target=\"_blank\">\n			<img src=\"/img/kelty-salida.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Best Tent For Stargazing - Kelty Salida\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n		</a>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n\n<p>This tent provides you with a 30.5 ft.² of floor space along with an additional 10 ft.² of vestibule. The center height is 43 inches. So, this is not the type of tent which you can stand up in.</p>\n\n<p>You should note that while the company suggests that the tent is large enough for two people, it is far more comfortable for one person. So, this tent is most suitable for the solo stargazer who just needs a little bit of extra space for equipment. If you need more room for additional people, there is also a four-person version of the tent available.</p>\n\n<p>You can set up this tent rapidly thanks to features like two pole construction and color-coded clip attachments. The first time we tried, it only took around five minutes. The second time, we were able to do it in under three minutes. Additionally, we found it comfortable and easy to carry to and from our site, thanks to its light weight and its compact poles which fold up when you collapse the tent. Even on a longer hike, it should not fit to you too much.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3k5P3uY\" target=\"_blank\">\n			<img src=\"/img/kelty-salida-gazing-view.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Kelty Salida - Stargazing view\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n		</a>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>The materials the tent is made from the include 68D nylon for the floor, 68D polyester for the walls, and 40D No-See-Um Mesh for the windows. All of these materials are rugged enough to stand up to wear and tear during backpacking expeditions. As for the mesh, it does do a great job keeping out mosquitoes and other unwanted visitors while still allowing you to look out at the stars.</p>\n\n<p>While it is probably best to plan on using this tent in dry conditions, you can set up the rain fly if you need to protect it from a bit of light rain (and yes, it does come with the tent, even though some listings are not clear on that point). It is worth noting, however, that despite the mesh windows permitting airflow, it can get to be a bit warm in this tent in a hot climate, probably because of its small size.</p>\n\n<p>Also, will you be setting up in a rocky area to view the stars? If so, you might want to replace the stakes the tent includes with some which are sturdier so they don’t bend. But in soft soil, the included stakes are perfect.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3k5P3uY\" target=\"_blank\">\n			<img src=\"/img/kelty-salida-screen.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Kelty Salida - Mesh viewing screen\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n		</a>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n\n<p>The D-door on the Kelty Salida Camping and Backpacking Tent makes it easy to climb in and out. This can be extra helpful if you need to bring equipment with you. Additionally, there are some storage pockets inside where you can keep smaller supplies for backpacking and astronomy.</p>\n\n<p>It took us a couple minutes longer to pack up the tent than it did to set it up, but it was not too tricky to get it into its roll top cube carry bag to hike back to our vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, one more reason to recommend the Kelty Salida Camping and Backpacking Tent is its price. There are competing products which cost significantly more, but which are no more durable and boast no more in terms of features than this tent. Plus, this one is lighter than a lot of the rest, and therefore better for backpacking.</p>\n\n<h4>The Kelty Salida Camping and Backpacking Tent Lets You Stargaze in Comfort</h4>\n\n<p>Stargazing can be a lot of fun, but there is a world of difference between doing it in town and doing it out in the backcountry. And once you have viewed the stars out in the wilderness, there really is no other way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>With the lightweight Kelty Salida Camping and Backpacking Tent, you can carry your tent a long distance into the backcountry without fatiguing.</p>\n\n<p>And thanks to its great design, you can stay dry and comfortable and protect your equipment while gazing up at the stars as you fall asleep.</p>\n\n<p>With its excellent features and its reasonable price, we feel it is the best value right now. So, consider picking up the Kelty Salida Camping and Backpacking Tent for your next backcountry stargazing adventure.</p>','/img/best-tent-for-stargazing.jpg','Best'),('best-tent-for-tall-person',58,'Best Tent For a Tall Person','Indoors are for head-bumping. You shouldn\'t have to worry about that on your camping trip. Check out our recommendation for the best tent for a tall person.','Derek Hunch','June 23, 2020','<p>If you are a tall person, you may have problems enough with low doorframes or clothing items which are too short. But if you want to go camping, you will have further hassles, since many tents cannot comfortably accommodate taller individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, this problem is not universal. In this article, we will introduce you to a tent which is a head above the rest (pun intended). But first, let&apos;s talk about what you need to consider when you are shopping for a tent to accommodate a tall person.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Considerations When Shopping for a Tent for a Tall Person</h3>\n\n<p>When shopping for a tent for a tall person, you need to ask yourself how you intend to use that tent, and what will make you comfortable.</p>\n\n<p>Do you want to be able to merely sit upright in the tent? Or do you want to be able to stand up at your full height without crouching? How much clearance do you want to have above your head?</p>\n\n<p>After you have the appropriate measurements in mind, you will be able to start shopping for a tent.</p>\n\n<p>You will want to note the maximum height at the center of the tent you are thinking of purchasing.</p>\n\n<p>Also pay attention to the slope of the roof of the tent. Ideally, the slope will not be too steep; that way, even if you are not standing directly in the center of the tent where the ceiling is highest, you might still be able to stand without crouching.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the overall dimensions of the tent as well, because you are going to be lying down to sleep for the night. The tent needs to have sufficient square footage that you can sprawl out comfortably. You do not want to have to sleep curled up in a ball.</p>\n\n<h3>Our Recommended Tent for a Tall Person: The Coleman 8-Person Tent</h3>\n\n<p>Now that we have talked about some key considerations for choosing a tent for taller occupants, let’s check out our recommended tent, which is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YqfEKo\">Coleman 8-Person Tent</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/tall-person-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Coleman 8-Man Tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>With two people working together, we were able to set up this tent in about five minutes on our first try. On our second try, we were able to do it in just three minutes. Once we had it set up, we double checked the measurements and found that it indeed, it measures 14 feet by 10 feet at the base. Standing in the very center, the height from floor to ceiling is 6 feet, 7 inches.</p>\n\n<p>Even our tallest team member, who is around 6 feet tall, was able to stand upright inside the tent with a few inches of extra clearance in the middle. For the most part, he was also able to you walk around inside the tent still relatively upright. He had to crouch a little closer to the edges, but not much.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to fit two queen-size airbeds on the floor of this tent, so sleeping comfortably isn&apos;t a problem even if you are very tall. Adding to the sense of spaciousness are a total of seven screened windows. So it is delightfully airy and breathable inside the tent, and you can enjoy beautiful views of your surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>Can you actually fit eight people in here? The answer to that question is yes—we tried it. Everybody fit inside the tent simultaneously, and it wasn’t even too crowded. Naturally, however, it will be a lot more roomy and luxurious with fewer people at a time.</p>\n\n<p>As to materials and build, the tent is made out of Polyguard 2x double thick fabric, which is sturdy enough to handle significant wear and tear without damage. We feel confident that this tent could perform great for years if you take proper care of it.</p>\n\n<p>Adding to the quality of the construction is the WeatherTec system with inverted seams and patented corner welds. These help you to stay comfortable and dry in light rain conditions, though it is highly recommended you get the rain fly for extra protection. And do not forget that sideways rain can easily blow inside through the windows if you leave them uncovered.</p>\n\n<p>Happily, zip-up covers come with the tent. So when you want to stop wind or precipitation from blowing inside, you can cover the windows fully. This also is a nice privacy feature if you are camping close to other people. We did notice it was hard to completely close off the windows at the very top. This is why we still suggest the rainfly in case of a downpour.</p>\n\n<p>Providing you with extra convenience, the tent includes mesh storage pockets built right into the walls. You can use these to keep your small accessories organized, handy, and off the floor.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of appearance, you have three different color options for the Coleman 8-Person Tent. You can get a gray and black color combination, a gray and blue color combination, or a brownish version of the tent. All three of these are neutral color combinations which should satisfy most tastes. </p>\n\n<p>The tent comes with a convenient carrying bag so that you can easily bring it to and from your campsite. We have seen a variety of measurements for the tent when it is inside the bag. When we checked, we came up with 46\"L x 16\" W x 15\" H. It took a little bit longer to put away the tent than it did to set it up, but this is typical with camping tents. It fit easily into the back of our vehicle.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion: The Coleman 8-Person Tent Can Comfortably Accommodate a Tall Person</h3>\n\n<p>Now you know what to expect if you choose the Coleman 8-Person Tent. Whether you are looking for a tent for eight people or not, it is an ideal option for one or more taller occupants. It offers excellent overhead clearance, is spacious, open, and airy, and is ruggedly built to stand up to the elements and regular use in a wide range of environments.</p>','/img/ferns.jpg','Best'),('best-tents-for-dogs',52,'Best Tents For Dogs','Going camping with your dog?

In this guide, we’ll go over some important features to look for when comparing tents for dogs, and then we’ll recommend some top options on the market right now.</p>\n\n \n\n<p>Please note that we’ll be focusing our guide on tents that you can share with your pet, rather than tents specifically (and exclusively) for dogs. Let’s begin.</p>\n\n \n\n<h2>Considerations When Choosing the Best Tent for Dogs</h2>\n\n \n\n<p>What makes a tent a suitable choice for camping with your dog? Here are some key features to look for:</p>\n\n \n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Rugged construction:</strong> You already know how adept dogs are at tearing up furnishings, pillows, and other things around your home. As you might expect, they are pretty good at destroying tents as well, even if they aren’t trying (tent floors can be particularly susceptible). So, invest in a tent featuring sturdy materials and construction (stitching, seams, etc.) which can handle your dog’s usual antics.</li>\n \n\n<li><strong>Quick and easy to assemble:</strong> Trying to assemble a tent with a dog running around trying to get your attention can be a challenge, so the faster and easier the assembly process for a particular tent is, the better.</li>\n \n\n<li><strong>Capacity:</strong> You could find yourself sleeping next to your dog in your tent whether or not it is your intent. So, make sure there is sufficient room for all humans and canines.</li>\n \n\n<li><strong>Vestibules:</strong> Not only do vestibules help you to keep the tent clean, but they also provide a separate area for your pet to sleep. But again, even if this is your plan, just be aware that harsh weather or anxiety could send your dog into your area of the tent—so be prepared for that when selecting a size.</li>\n \n\n<li><strong>Multiple entrances:</strong> It is easier to get in and out of your tent in an orderly fashion if you and your dog are not vying for a single entrance, especially if it is <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">windy or raining</a> and you are in a rush to get in.</li>\n \n\n<li><strong>Easy to clean:</strong> Camping with a dog tends to be a proposition that involves a lot of dirt and mud, so invest in a tent which you can clean easily.</li>\n</ul> \n\n<p>Now that you know what to look for in a tent for a dog, let’s go over some top recommended options.</p>\n\n \n\n<h2>Our Recommended Tents for Camping With Your Dog</h2>\n\n \n\n<h3>Best Overall Tent for Dogs</h3>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n    <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sV0IgO7EL._AC_SL1000_.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/38ibOVK\" target=\"_blank\">Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room</a></h4>\n\n \n\n<p>The Coleman Dome Tent with Screen Room is our top overall choice for camping with your dog. The tent comes in two sizes: 6-person or 8-person. It is made of sturdy polyester, and includes a screened-in porch/vestibule. Your purchase includes a carry bag for convenient transport and storage.</p>\n\n \n\n<h5>Pros:</h5>\n\n \n\n<p>The high capacity of this tent makes it ideal even if you have a large canine companion sleeping in the interior.

So, if the weather gets bad, your dog will probably need to sleep next to you, not in the vestibule.</p>\n \n\n<h3>Best Easy Assembly Tent for Dogs</h3>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n    <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RTFTgorZL._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Coleman Steel Creek Fast Pitch Dome Tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n  </div>\n</div>\n \n\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TP6ndh\" target=\"_blank\">Coleman Steel Creek Fast Pitch Dome Tent with Screen Room</a></h4>\n\n \n\n<p>This dome tent, also by Coleman, is similar to our top overall choice.

Camping has been around for centuries but people still ask what is the best camping tent to buy and how do you know if you are purchasing the right one. There are a lot of different variables that one should consider when purchasing a tent, but fortunately, there is a lot of information out there to help you make a conscious and intelligent decision. Camping tents come in many shapes and sizes and you will need to understand each of their uses and attributes in order to make the best decision for your camping experience.</p> <h3>Intended Use</h3> <p>First, it is important to understand what are you using this camping tent for. Do you need one that is lightweight because you are going to just be standard ground, or are you going to need a more durable tent because you are going high in the mountains with varying wind speeds? It is not always lucrative or important to grab the biggest, most expensive tent you can buy. Sometimes, the standard run-of-the-mill tent can be right what you need. Keep the use-case of the tent in mind when browsing different tents to make the determination in what is right for you.</p> <h3>Portability</h3> <p>Weight in tents is another attribute that needs to be considered. There are tents that will tell you right on the box what their purpose is. If you are backpacking, normally the tent will have that information on there so you know it is a heavier tent to allow for the average backpacker to sleep with more gear. If you find yourself buying a camping tent for the express purpose of hiking, you will want something ultralightweight because it will be on you the entire time. This is not a variable to consider if you are car camping, which basically means bringing your car with you while you are camping, because you can store the heavier tent on the inside.</p> <p>The size of the camping tent you grab can also be a very important variable. For example, if you find yourself camping for extended periods or with multiple people than you may want a large tent. These large tents can even come with separate zipped rooms inside, and a mesh floor for a flooring-like atmosphere on the inside. If it is just you camping, or maybe just one other person, a smaller camping tent to nail down may be just what you need. More room can also mean more gear, but more room also means a large price tag.</p> <p>Camping tents are interesting in themselves because they can come in varying degrees of portability and use. For example, when people think of camping tents they more than likely think of your standard triangle tent but there are even large dome tents that exist now to help you view the outdoors and provide a roomier atmosphere than normal. There are also tents that have eight people in mind with mesh-like doors to access. The type of tent you buy will certainly be dependent on the number of people coming and the purpose of the trip, but do not go down the trip of spending more money than necessary when your standard, cheap tent would have done the job just fine.</p> <h3>Climate</h3> <p>Paying attention to the weather is very important when deciding on the tent to buy. If you know you are camping in a region that has more rainfall than others, you will want the <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">best waterproof tent for rain</a> that is more durable and can provide adequate shelter. If you are camping in a dry region that is mostly sunny with high temperatures, you will want a tent that supports reflection and has proper ventilation for when the wind does decide to come through. These are all important factors to remember when battling the harsh atmosphere of the outdoors.</p> <div class=\"row\">     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\"> <img src=\"/img/rain-on-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Raindrops on tent\"> </div> </div> <br/> <p>An interesting attribute when it comes to the world of camping tents is seasonality. Seasonality essentially means your tent was made to handle multiple or few seasons of the year. There are 3-season tents and 4-season tents. The most popular choice among these two are the 3-season tents as these tents were intended to keep you dry whether it be through rain or snow, shield you from the many different bugs that exist in the outdoors, and provide a level of privacy you are most likely accustomed to. 4-season tents, on the other hand, are made for someone who tends to camp with substantial amounts of snow and heavy weather ahead. These are for the people who scale mountains or high several miles on high landscapes. 4-season tents are most likely not going to be what you are after so 3-season tents are a term to keep in mind during your search.</p> <p>When it comes to waterproofing your tent, there are plenty of options out there. For one, you have the rainfly which is a cover that fits over the roof of your tent. This cover not only adds a little warmth to your tent but also bounces that rain right off of the tent to land on the floor around you. To enhance that rainfly and make your tent even more waterproof, you can even purchase a spray that acts as a repellent. There are durable water repellents that exist that helps repel the water and keep your tent nice and dry during hard rain showers. All you have to do to adhere your durable water repellent is first to spray down the tent with clean water, apply the durable water repellent spray over the exterior of your rainfly, wait a couple minutes and wipe off the excess coating, and let the tent dry. Once dry, you are protected against the wet elements and good to survive in stormy weather. There are also other things you can do to keep your tent waterproof, such as sealing the seams and refreshing the inside of your rainfly with a urethane coating, but most people will go with a durable water repellent in order to keep that rain at bay.</p> <div class=\"row\">     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\"> <img src=\"/img/tent-rain-fly.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Setting up tent rain fly\"> </div> </div> <br/> <p>All in all, what you choose to buy and how you waterproof your tent will be up to you. There are multiple ways to do it and multiple tents to buy and none are the wrong choice. Figure out what works best for your upcoming trip and make the best decision for you.</p> <h3>Durabilty and Ease of Use</h3> <p>Durability is definitely something that you will want to consider. There are camping tents that that have a more leather-like material, or even some that have a harder alloy than your mesh tent. These camping tents are created for someone who does camping for sport rather than just for recreation. Keep durability in mind if you want to save yourself hundreds of dollars as not everyone needs the thickest, hardest tent out there.</p> <p>A lot of beginner campers and hikers might not consider this, but the ease of use is something you definitely want to keep in mind before purchasing a tent. There are all sorts of tents that are highly geared towards expert campers rather than the novice one. There are some shelters that come with multiple rooms, windows, special tools to nail them to certain flooring, and even ones that come in multiple pieces. Keep that in mind when searching for tents as you may find yourself with the perfect tent that is too complicated to put together alone.</p> <p>To help determine the ease of use of a given shelter, one thing that many people forget to do is test the tent out for themselves. Just going to the store and reading the outside label of a box is not going to do much for you. Actually opening the tent, getting inside, seeing the inner mechanisms of the tent, and pitching it yourself is going to be the best thing you can do before committing to a purchase. You may notice it is bigger than what you wanted, or maybe even more cramped. It could be too stuffy inside rather than the breeze-filled tent you thought you were getting. Much like a car, test driving a tent can save you hours of research and help you commit to a more solid purchase. With generous return policies from online stores and Amazon, rest assured that if a product doesn\'t live up to your expectations an easy process to return the tent and find one that will suit your needs is easier than ever.</p> <div class=\"row\">     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4\"> <img src=\"/img/tent-pole-setup.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Connecting tent poles\"> </div> </div> <br/> <p>In line with ease of use, you will want to keep in mind what your tent uses as tent poles. The tent pole structure is essentially the skeleton of your tent and the way your tent stays in place while you are camping inside. More difficult, intricate tent poles exist in order to increase stability and security but can often be too confusing for the average camper. Easier tent pole setup may not keep your camping tent in place like the more complex ones can, but it is certainly quicker to put up and easier to get started on your camping trip. These types of camping tents will have fewer poles to put down which allows for a faster setup and faster pickup. These tents will also sometimes use clips, and poles so you have a level of strength and ventilation with your experience.</p>','/img/tent-on-hillside.jpg','Camping'),('canopy-alternatives',61,'Alternative Canopy Shelters','Canopy tents aren\'t the only types of shelter.

Three-sided pop-up tents with a dome structure are particularly popular for the beach.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<a href=\"/best-beach-tents\">\n			<img src=\"/img/best-beach-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Beach Tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n		</a>\n		<p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click to see our top rated beach tents.</small></p>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Beach tents and camping tents are usually lightweight and easy to carry.</li>\n<li>You can often set up these types of tents in minutes.</li>\n<li>You have shade and shelter on most or all sides, depending on the configuration of tent.</li>\n<li>These tents are designed with ventilation to be breathable and comfortable.</li>\n<li>The tent may include a floor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Wind could destabilize this type of tent.</li>\n<li>Usually there is not enough vertical clearance to stand upright in a beach tent.</li>\n<li>These tents usually are most appropriate for one or two people, or possibly a small family.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Gazebos</h3>\n\n<p>If you are hosting an event, you might be wondering whether a traditional gazebo is a good alternative to a canopy tent. A gazebo is similar in structure to a canopy tent, except that it is permanent.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<a href=\"/best-pop-up-gazebo\">\n			<img src=\"/img/metal-gazebo.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Pop up Gazebo\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n		</a>\n		<p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click to see our top rated gazebos.</small></p>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If you already have a gazebo on-site, it makes sense to utilize what you already have if possible.</li>\n<li>If you will be hosting regular events in the future, a gazebo is a permanent shade solution.</li>\n<li>Once a gazebo is in place, you do not need to deal with setup in the future. Also, it is a heavy, stable structure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A gazebo is not particularly portable.</li>\n<li>Initial assembly of a gazebo takes more time and effort than setting up a tent.</li>\n<li>Gazebos are much more expensive than canopy tents. If you do not need a permanent solution, a gazebo is overkill.</li>\n<li>You may not have space on-site for a permanent structure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Oversized umbrellas</h3>\n\n<p>An oversized umbrella is just a very large umbrella which you can bring with you to the beach or other settings for shade.</p>\n\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An umbrella is a simple solution with easy and fast setup.</li>\n<li>You can reposition an umbrella pretty easily as the sun moves.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t get a huge amount of coverage even from a really big umbrella.</li>\n<li>Even with air vents, it is pretty easy to destabilize an umbrella.</li>\n<li>If your umbrella does invert, it may be damaged.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Sun shelters</h3>\n\n<p>These minimalist products generally take the form of an awning held up by 2 or 4 poles. The corners extend out and down to the ground like guy lines, ending in anchors.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<a href=\"/blog/neso-grande-beach-canopy\">\n			<img src=\"/img/beach-shade-canopy.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Sun Shelter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n		</a>\n		<p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click for more info on the Neso Grande.</small></p>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>There is also a related product which simply consists of a rainfly between two poles plus guy lines for stability.</p>\n\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Sun shelters are simple, elegant, and lightweight.</li>\n<li>You can adjust the sun shelter to your liking to provide the right amount and angle of shade.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes there are stability issues with these shelters. So, they may not be ideal if it is windy.\n\n<h3>Canopy umbrellas</h3>\n\n<p>This product is a kind of hybrid between an oversized beach umbrella and a beach tent. You prop it up on the ground, and it has extensions on the sides to provide you with additional shade.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2tbcSKC\" target=\"_blank\">\n			<img src=\"/img/pop-up-sun-shelter.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Sport-Brella\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n		</a>\n		<p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click to see the Sport-Brella on Amazon.</small></p>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<p>These shelters combine the simplicity and versatility of an oversized umbrella with the additional shade and shelter benefits of a beach tent.</p>\n\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Like regular oversized umbrellas, it is easy for these shelters to blow over in a strong wind.</li>\n<li>Only around 2-3 people can fit underneath this type of shelter.</li>\n<li>You cannot stand up under one of these umbrellas.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Homemade shelters</h3>\n\n<p>You can always set up some poles or even pieces of driftwood, and hang a <a href=\"https://www.tactical.com/how-to-build-tarp-shelter-configurations/\" target=\"_blank\">tarp</a> or such between them.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/tarp-shelter.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Tarp Shelter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This can work as an impromptu solution if you do not have time to plan in advance, but still have some basic supplies at hand.</li>\n<li>It is easy to customize your shelter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You may have a hard time securing the sheet to the poles.

Below are just a few of the reasons why such an item is one of the best things you can purchase for your Fourth of July bash:</p>\n\n<h4>Staying Dry</h4>\n\n<p>Although it may seem obvious, many people take their chances with rain and simply hope for the best. However, if inclement weather does visit your property on Independence Day and you do not have a tent in place, you must resign yourself to cramming all your guests into your living room. However, a high-quality pop up canopy tent allows you to have an enjoyable day regardless of what mother nature has in store. Consider putting your tent up a few days before your barbecue, as this will ensure your party area has time to dry even if it rains the day before your event.</p>\n\n<h4>Protection From the Sun and Heat</h4>\n\n<p>Since most parts of the country experience their <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/08/15/july-warmest-month-on-record-nasa-finds/#HGsbQxOS2Oqn\">warmest temperatures in July</a>, it is definitely a good idea to have a tent for your gathering under which your guests can seek shelter from the heat and avoid sunburns. A pop up tent with no sidewalls works well for a backyard barbecue, as it lets in the breeze but still provides protection from the sun.</p>\n\n<h4>A Tent Protects Food and Beverages</h4>\n\n<p>Although open-air parties are great for your guests, the elements are not good for food and beverages. A pop up canopy tent keeps bugs, animals, twigs and leaves from crashing your party. Additionally, your plans likely include serving side dishes, such as salad, coleslaw, pasta, potato salad and desserts. Keeping such fare out of the sun can help you avoid unpleasant scenarios such as food poisoning or spoiled dishes. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blog/grilling-under-canopy\">A pop up tent can also be erected over your built-in barbecue grills</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Planning Activities</h4>\n\n<p>You can plan far more activities if you invest in a pop up tent than if you simply held a backyard barbecue party with no shelter. For example, you can set up parlor games for children during the daytime and then use the same area as a mini dance floor if your party continues into the evening. You can section off one end of the tent for a grab game or piñata, and create another area for card games or similar activities.</p>\n\n<h4>Decorating Advantages</h4>\n\n<p>Decorating options for your pop up canopy tent are limited only by your imagination. Although there are many designs from which to choose when decorating your backyard, party tents give you the ideal canvas on which to work. You can hang curtains, streamers, lights, lanterns or essentially any other decoration you desire, making it easy to create the environment of your choice.</p>\n\n<h4>Keeping Your Guests Outside</h4>\n\n<p>Although you probably know the people you are inviting to your gathering, everyone has had the experience of a rogue guest or two wandering into areas of their home to which they were not invited. Keeping guests comfortable outdoors gives them few reasons to enter your dwelling and makes it easier to supervise those who come inside on occasion.</p>\n\n<h4>Versatility</h4>\n\n<p>Investing in a pop up canopy tent for the Fourth of July can offer you unexpected benefits, as it can be used for other purposes at different times of the year. For example, long after Independence Day is over, you may decide to hold a birthday party, wedding reception or anniversary on your property and you can use and decorate your tent to suit the occasion.</p>\n\n<h4>Organizing Your Event</h4>\n\n<p>Pop up tents are a great way to keep people in a specific area of your property. Unless your backyard is extremely small, most guests will drift into different corners and your party may become isolated groups of people rather than a big gathering. A party tent brings everyone together and creates a far more sociable setting than would be the case if you did not use such a tent. This is especially true if people have not seen each other in quite a while or if you plan to have guests who have never met prior to the party.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth of July backyard barbecue events are enjoyable and easy to plan, regardless of whether your gathering is large or small. To make your party even more enjoyable, consider investing in a good quality pop up canopy tent that can be used for many future years.</p>','/img/july-4.jpg','Misc'),('canopy-tent-accessories',16,'Pop up canopy tent accessories','We suggest a few extra items that you can purchase to take your pop up canopy to the next level.','Eric Schroeder','November 19, 2017','<p>So you recently broke down and purchased a canopy tent. After some thorough research you found the tent that will best suit your needs; whether it is a tent for the backyard, the beach, a child\'s sporting event, or farmer’s market booth as a promotional tool for your business. And perhaps you bought the tent at a local store without any of the extras a lot of tents online offer now-a-days. We would like to highlight a few of the best pop up canopy tent accessories that anyone can add-on to their tent to make it more versatile or valuable depending on the conditions.</p>\n\n\n<p>For starters, the most common accessory to any canopy tent is a roller bag. While most online purchases will include this with the purchase of a tent, perhaps the one you purchased was at a local store or market and did not come with one. Since the average weight of a canopy comes in at 40 lbs, a roller bag is often a necessity. While some owners purchase their tent for backyard use, most people use their tent at events or outside of the house which means portability is a big criterion for most buyers. When looking at which roller bag is best for you, it is important to pay close attention to the wheels of the bag. The older style bags typically have wheels embedded or built into in the bottom of the bag, which usually means they are small and only a few inches apart from each other. We highly recommend looking for wheels that share an axel, are located on the outside of the bag and are over 3\" in radius. We have found that having wheels on the outside of the bag rather than built into the bag significantly increases stability when rolling on concrete, grass or sand. We\'ve tested so many bags with small wheels in the bottom of a carrying bag that get \'speed wobbles\' when walking or easily tip over at the slightest turn. Be sure to find a carrying bag with some oversized wheels, you\'ll be glad you did.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n    	<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2AEbSiG\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n            <img src=\"/img/wheeled-bag.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Canopy Tent Bag\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;\"/>\n        </a>\n        <p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click on image to see canopy tent bag prices on Amazon</small></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>Another important thing every canopy tent owner needs to think about is a way to safely secure their tent to the ground. Especially true for tents manufactured without a vent at the top of the canopy to allow wind to pass through, a tent can quickly and unexpectedly be turned into a flying weapon if a gust of wind catches it at just the right angle. There are a couple of options for owners to be assured this will not happen. The first is a set of stakes for each leg. The <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com\">best pop up canopy tents</a> have a hole in the welded steel or aluminum feet that allows a steel stake to easily pass through. Stakes often come included with most pop up canopy purchases; however they are usually only a few inches long and will not suffice for most windy conditions. We recommend purchasing stakes that are at least 6\" in length, and even longer 12” stakes if you intent to use your tent on the beach. The second way to keep a 10x10 shelter secure is with guy line ropes. Guy line ropes are tie downs that typically secure to the top of the tent at each corner and are secured into the ground with stakes. Through our research and testing we have found that this is the most effective way to ensure a tent will stay securely fastened to the ground. However not all venues are accommodating to this method. Anytime space is limited such as at a tailgate, a trade show, or street fair; guy lines are not the best option due to limited space and the potential tripping hazard they pose. Conversely, we found that campers prefer guy lines as they are lightweight, compact and easily fit in a camping backpack and space is often not an issue at a camp site. If you do choose guy lines as a mean to secure your tent, we recommend purchasing reflective rope so that they are easily visible to people passing by or in dark conditions. The last option to secure a tent, and probably the most common, is the use of weights. We have found that weights are the perfect way to keep a tent secure at confined events. Perfect for a trade show, trip to the beach, a child\'s soccer game; weights typically come in the option of a sand bag or hardshell plastic. We found that a 5 lbs. weight on each leg can withstand the occasional gust and should be enough to keep your tent securely on the ground. If you anticipate prolonged sustain winds we would recommend 20 lbs. weight bags fastened to each leg. Overall, don\'t assume the small stakes included with your purchase will be sufficient enough to keep your tent safely on the ground. Find an alternative for whatever your intended use is with the options we have recommended for each venue or scenario.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n    	<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2AGhetR\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n            <img src=\"/img/guy-line.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Canopy Tent Guy Line\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;\"/>\n        </a>\n        <p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click on image to see guy line prices on Amazon</small></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>One of the most popular add-on accessories for any pop up canopy tent is the sunwall. The sunwall has grown in popularity over the past decade as manufacturers have found unique and convenient ways to easily attached them to the canopy valance. A sunwall serves two purposes. First and most obvious, it provides people with protection from a rising or setting sun. When the sun is just above the horizon the canopy top itself doesn\'t provide ample shade as shadows are longer than they are when the sun is directly overhead and a sunwall will significantly increase shade. A second and often overlooked reason to purchase a sunwall for your tent is the privacy that they provide during those crowded days at the beach. When beaches are packed and strangers are within feet of each other, it’s nice to have a little privacy underneath the canopy tent to get away from the glares of your next door neighbor. The most common way to fasten a wall to the canopy valance is typically with Velcro, however we have seen quite a few with clips in recent years as these are often more interchange amongst brands. Most canopy tent manufacturers make their own sunwalls which easily connect to the canopy valance. However if purchasing different brands be sure to double check how the two connect as not all are compatible with each other.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n    	<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ibcd4Z\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n            <img src=\"/img/side-wall.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Canopy Tent Sun Wall\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;\"/>\n        </a>\n        <p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click on image to see sun wall prices on Amazon</small></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>And lastly, one of the coolest add-on accessories for canopy tents that we have seen is a gutter that connects to the valances of two adjoining shelters. This is the perfect rainy weather accessory for tailgates, fairs, trade shows, or farmers markets with multiple canopy tents side by side. So many times we have seen two connecting tents compromised by a wall of water dripping or pouring into the middle along the connecting sides. Constructed with 600 denier polyester it is 100% waterproof and perfectly channels water away from the center of the tent from the smooth seal of Velcro along the canopy valances. It is such a perfect design we wonder why it took so long for someone to figure it out. It’s one of those things you didn\'t know you needed until you have it, and now you will never want to go without it. No more wet ground from drips in the middle of your tents. This accessory has saved us numerous times tailgating with a large group of friends and family.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n    	<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2yAgTY0\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n            <img src=\"/img/gutter.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Canopy Tent Gutter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;\"/>\n        </a>\n        <p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click on image to see canopy gutter prices on Amazon</small></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>We have found in our research that these are some of the best pop up canopy tent accessories of hope that these add-on canopy tent suggestions provide some insight and clarity if you were on the fence of purchasing one. We think that the more options a buyer has will ultimately make their time underneath a canopy tent more comfortable and increase the chances of preparedness in the event of adverse conditions.

Following are some ways in which a canopy tent can enhance a day at the beach which you may not have considered.</p>\n\n<h3>Protect yourself from UV rays</h3>\n<p>Most canopy tents don&apos;t just provide you with shade from visible light, but also \n  <a href=\"/blog/finding-the-right-beach-tent\">screen out harmful UV rays</a> to some degree.\n</p>\n\n<p>Although your canopy tent cannot perform the same job as sunscreen, it can offer you a second degree of protection and do same for your kids, pets, or whomever else might be sharing the shade of the tent with you.</p>\n\n<p>That means it does not just make your trip to the beach more pleasant, but also healthier and safer.</p>\n\n<h3>Prevent sun damage of your clothing, towels, and other items</h3>\n\n<p>If you leave an item out in direct sunlight for an extended period of time, it can lead to bleaching and discoloration, and sometimes other damage as well (i.e. plastic containers can become brittle and prone to fracturing).</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/flip-flops.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Flip Flops on the beach\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>With a canopy tent providing shade for your attire and more, your possessions are less likely to end up bleached at the end of the day.</p>\n\n<h3>Keep food from going bad longer</h3>\n\n<p>Don’t own a cooler? If you have brought food with you which can spoil (i.e. fruit, sandwiches, etc.), that process will be accelerated if your food is sitting out in the bright sun.</p>\n\n<p>But if you keep your food under the shade of the canopy tent, but should slow down the spoiling process.</p>\n\n<h3>Keep water colder longer</h3>\n\n<p>Another advantage of a canopy tent if you do not have a cooler is that you can keep your water bottle colder for a longer period of time.</p>\n\n<p>As with leaving food out in direct sunlight, leaving a bottle of ice water out in direct sunlight is going to cause its contents to heat up rapidly. The result will be tepid water much sooner than you’d like.</p>\n\n<p>But under the shade of a canopy tent, the ice in your bottles will melt more gradually, so your water will remain cold and refreshing for a longer part of the day.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, you really don’t want to leave food and water in plastic containers like bottles or bins exposed to heat and light. Why? Because intense heat and light can promote the breakdown of the plastic, which can leach chemicals into your food and beverages.</p>\n\n<p>It is better for your health and for the flavor and odor of your food and water not to let this happen, and there, a canopy can help.</p><! –– canopy-tent-benefits-blog.jpg ––>\n\n<h3>Reduce dehydration</h3>\n\n<p>Dehydration can be a major problem at the beach. On a bright, cloudless, hot day, the danger is greatest—but it doesn’t go away when the sky is overcast or the weather is cooler.</p>\n\n<p>Just being outdoors for an extended period of time can dehydrate you. And the continuous breeze which is common along the coast in many locations can strip moisture from your skin, causing you to dehydrate even faster.</p>\n\n<p>How can a canopy tent help? It provides an extra layer of shade, keeping you cooler, it helps block out at least a little of the wind, especially with a sunwall, and (as just discussed) it can keep your beverages cool and appealing, encouraging you to drink more.</p>\n\n<p>It sure is better to stay hydrated than it is to have to end your day at the beach early because you’ve come down with a headache. On a related note, if you are prone to migraines triggered by sunlight, you are less likely to get one if you are under your canopy’s shade!</p>\n\n<h3>Increase privacy with a sunwall</h3>\n\n<p>When you plan a day at the beach, what do you envision? Probably a quiet, serene day, the wide open sand stretching around you for miles without another soul in sight.</p>\n\n<p>But what is the reality typically like? Unless you live in a rural location, probably quite a bit different. Instead of the private, quiet day at the beach you might have envisioned, you may find yourself wading through crowds.</p>\n\n<p>A canopy tent can help with this problem. If you install one or more \n  <a href=\"/blog/canopy-tent-accessories\">sunwalls on your tent</a> (which is as easy as attaching them with Velcro), you can screen some of those crowds from view. You also can stay out of view yourself.\n</p>\n\n<p>It is much easier to relax when you don’t have to watch other people or be watched by them. If you spend most of the day under the shade of your tent, you might even forget just how many people are sharing the beach with you!</p>\n\n<h3>Stay at the beach longer and have a more enjoyable time</h3>\n\n<p>When you add together all of the benefits listed above—plus the basic benefits of shade and wind protection—it is easy to see how a canopy tent makes a trip to the beach more comfortable all around.</p>\n\n<p>That comfort extends not just to you, but to anyone who joins you on your outing. Children and pets in particular, who may be extra prone to fatigue, will probably have a better time, complain less, and tire out later than they would without a canopy tent.</p>\n\n<p>In that way, a canopy tent gives you the \n  <a href=\"/blog/beach-good-for-health\">freedom to spend more time</a> on the beach before you need to pack up for the day and head home.\n</p>\n\n<p>You will also have better memories of your beach trip. Instead of roasting on the hot sand with lukewarm water to drink, you’ll remember luxuriating in the shade with ice cold water well into the day.</p>\n\n<p>Want to learn more about canopy tents for beach vacations?

It embarrasses me to admit this, but I have fallen victim to a strong gust of wind before. More than once actually. The whole reason you deploy a canopy tent is to protect yourself and your necessities from the elements so it can be very frustrating when you have to fight the weather and salvage a flipped shelter. Fortunately, there are a couple different reliable options for protecting yourself from these circumstances. We have experimented with a wide variety of weights, sandbags, ropes, tent pegs, and a couple other products and have narrowed our recommendations down to three categories: Tie-downs, weights, and stakes.</p>\r\n\n<h4>Tie-Downs</h4>\n\n<p>The least expensive and arguably the most reliable product that you can use to secure your canopy tent and protect it from the wind is a simple rope and stake. The concept is pretty straightforward. A cord is attached to some place on each of the legs, pulled taught, and anchored to some place else on the ground. Most canopy tents come with a set of tie-down cords but it may be worth looking elsewhere if the tie downs that were included with your shelter are low quality. First look at the composition of the cord. Chances are they are braided nylon or some other synthetic material which is good. As I discussed in a previous blog post\n <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com/blog/synthetic-fabric\">Man made canopy fabric... Is it worth it?</a>, \nman made materials are strong and inexpensive. If the cord has a frayed end look at the \"guts\" of the cord to see if the it contains strands that run inside of the braided shell like the following image.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4 col-xs-12\">\n		<img src=\"/img/frayed-parachute-cord.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Frayed canopy tent tie-down cord\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n	</div>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If the cord does contain these strands, then you are in good shape because your cord can probably support up to 550 lbs before it breaks. If it doesn’t have this filler, you still might be ok though. Unfilled nylon cord can often still support 200 lbs, but it might be worth it to invest in stronger cord if you think you might be in windy situations. Remember to take a lighter and melt the tips of the frayed cord to prevent the fray from progressing farther down the cord.</p>\r\n\n<p>The types of cords that you want to be aware of are cords that are made with natural fibers like cotton or twine. When you squeeze the cord between your fingers and rub back and forth, if your cord feels “stringy” and you can feel the fibers moving and separating, you probably want to think about investing in a more reliable tie-down. We recommend parachute cord like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IIOJSWQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00IIOJSWQ&linkId=5d49a2fd284636888c83d8e512866e60\">Titan Mil-Spec 550 Paracord</a></p>\r\n\n<p>Tie downs are effective but their performance is reliant on the fastening points. The first anchor point that you should consider is where the cord will be attached to the canopy tent itself. We have come across two styles of tie down anchors. The first is where the tie-downs attach to somewhere on the shelter frame. This is the style that we prefer and see in many of our best canopy tents. In our opinion it only makes sense that you should attach an anchor point to the strongest part of the equipment, the frame. The other style that we have come across is where the anchor point is located somewhere on the canopy fabric. We have seen examples where a cord is looped through an eyehole on the canopy itself. We experimented by yanking on the cord over and over again, trying to simulate shock from a windy day, and the material around the eyehole started to fray and stretch fairly quickly. We have also seen examples of shelters that have canopy tie down anchors reinforced by heavy-duty nylon patches similar to the material used in ratchet straps. These reinforced nylon anchors passed our simulated wind tests well.</p>\r\n\n<h4>Stakes</h4>\r\n\n<p>The problem is that tie downs will only be effective if you have something to tie the canopy tent down to. It doesn’t matter how strong the frame anchor is if you don’t have anything on the other side to act as the other anchor. This is where stakes can be valuable.</p>\r\n\n<p>If your canopy tent comes with tie downs, it might come with stakes as well. Just like the tie-down cords, we have noticed that many companies get cheap with their stakes too. The skinny steel ones that we have come across bend as soon as they hit a rock in the ground, especially if they are being pounded into the ground with a mallet. If you can bend your stakes with your hands then they are not strong enough to be a reliable solution. If you do decide that you need stakes, whether it is because you don’t have any or because you need to replace your low quality ones, then make sure you consider the type of ground that you will be anchoring your shelter to. Different stakes are appropriate for different terrains.</p>\r\n\n<p>For example, if you intend to use your canopy tent at the beach then a traditional tent stake won\'t be useful to you because it won’t stay rooted in the sand. Sandy environments require you to use a stake with a wider shaft. We have found that stakes that are threaded like screws are actually the most effective. Trial and error led us to a product called the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B28QS8G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01B28QS8G&linkId=1a59f0555a94268ea3b28b19ae527365\">Orange Screw</a> that was best stake for a canopy tent that will be used in the sand.</p>\r\n\n<p>If you are looking for a more affordable stake for a canopy tent that will be used in the sand, we found that the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FF54P4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00FF54P4C&linkId=aa8556350b1d2465cc57378c79d7d6ab\">Bluecell Snow and Sand stakes</a> also provided solid anchor points in loose terrain.</p>\r\n\n<p>If you need to anchor your canopy tent at a soccer game, picnic, or any other grassy terrain, then you will probably be pounding stakes into dirt. In this situation sand stakes will not work for you. They are too wide and will be difficult to pound into the ground because wider stakes will get stuck on rocks under the ground and will also be held up by friction. If you plan on anchoring your canopy tent into dirt, then we recommend this set of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016CQZ8AM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B016CQZ8AM&linkId=db505d4d18bcd1b049cab9e5d9d9ea0c\">10.5\" Heavy Duty Tent Pegs.</a></p>\n\n<p>Stakes provide you with an alternative option that can be useful at times. Many canopy tent frames have holes in their feet. These holes exist so that you can put a stake directly through the feet and anchor your shelter to the ground without needing cord to tie down. Physics tells us that the wider that you can spread your anchor points, the stronger your anchors will be. This is because the force is pulling the stakes at an angle against the earth instead of up and out of the earth. By putting the stakes directly through the feet of your canopy tent, you loose some of the strength of a wide base. So you should only exercise this option when it is unfeasible to use cords and wide anchor points. We like the stakes above because their shaft is skinny enough that they can fit through most foot holes, but they are still strong enough that they won’t bend if you pound them into a rock.</p>\n\n<h4>Weights</h4>\r\n\n<p>We have covered different options for anchoring the shelter to the ground, but what happens when you are on surface that doesn’t allow you to pound a stake into it. For example, what if you are on asphalt, or gravel, or even indoors? Well, we saved the best for last. Weights are the most flexible of all of the options that we have experimented with because you don’t need to break any ground.</p>\r\n\n<p>The concept of a canopy tent weight is simple. You anchor the feet of the shelter frame to the ground by attaching weights at the bottom. The weights hold down the feet of the canopy tent instead of a stake. Since you don’t need to pound anything into the ground, you have the option of using weights pretty much anywhere. Weights are also desirable because they are quick and easy to use. While we were testing stakes and tie downs we were averaging about 5 minutes in set up time to firmly secure the shelter. When we tested weights our average deployment time was less than 2 minutes.</p>\r\n\n<p>There are two types of weights: bag weights and traditional weights. We like bag weights the best because they are portable if you need them to be. Bag weights require that you fill them with some substance like gravel or sand ahead of time to provide the weight. This can be a benefit because you can empty the bags if you need them to be lightweight for transportation. We saw encouraging results from pretty much all of the bag weights that we tested, so we recommend not wasting your money on anything too expensive. We like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NN5LRVK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00NN5LRVK&linkId=fdb280a46e4f66fcb6756fd8105fceef\">Ohuhu\'s Instant Canopy Weights</a> because they were effective and affordable.</p>\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for something less messy and a little easier to use then you might be more interested in traditional weights. Traditional weights are solid plastic plates like you would see at a gym. They have a section cut out of them so that you can slide them around the legs of your shelter. The drawback to traditional weights is that you can’t \"empty\" them so anytime you transport them you will need to transport them at their full weight. Traditional weights tend to be a little lighter than a full bag weight for this reason. Manufacturers are trying to balance portability with effectiveness. Despite the fact that bag weights usually weigh in heavier, at 40lbs, we didn’t notice any significant performance drawbacks with the 30 lb traditional weights. We recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J43Y2T4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00J43Y2T4&linkId=09fee1230cc89798fde43ad1857b0ede\">Us Tailgater Weights</a> as the best traditional weights to secure your canopy tent.</p>\r\n\n<p>Whether you decide to go with one of our suggestions or have your own process for anchoring your tent, we strongly recommend you prepare for wind whenever you set up your canopy tent. An unsecured shelter will be ineffective and cause you more trouble if it blows over. We have seen it too many times.

A canopy tent allows you to set up wherever you want without the sun being a problem.</p>\n<p>But that does not mean that every spot on the beach is ideal for setting up a canopy tent. Following are some tips to help you find the most suitable site for your tent on your next beach trip.</p>\n<h3>Choose a beach where you can use the tent</h3>\n<p>Before you can set up a <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">canopy tent on a beach</a>, you need to check to see whether you can do so according to the rules and regulations for that beach.</p>\n<p>While quite a few beaches are more than happy to let you use your canopy tent, others prohibit tents altogether. Some may allow tents, but only if they measure within certain dimensions. Here are some rundowns of canopy tent regulations in Ocean City, Maryland that you might find useful, but ultimately every town has their own set of rules you must abide by.</p>\n<h3>Pick a location which isn&rsquo;t too close to the water</h3>\n<p>After you have decided on a beach for your outing with your canopy tent, you&apos;ll need to figure out the best spot to pitch your tent.</p>\n<p>One aspect to consider, especially if you will be spending many hours at the beach, is the tides. While you can set up many canopy tents within just a couple of minutes and take them down about as quickly, it is still ideal if you only need to set up your tent and take it down once.</p>\n<p>So avoid choosing a site which is located too close to the water. That way, if the tide comes up, you may not need to relocate.</p>\n<h3>Set up in a spot where you have some shelter from the wind</h3>\n<p>A canopy tent only has a roof. Usually, there are no side panels, although there are some tents you can purchase which have side panels that you can attach or detach (or roll up or roll down) as necessary.</p>\n<p>There are both benefits and drawbacks to this design. On one hand, you get plenty of airflow. This prevents the space underneath your canopy tent from overheating in the bright sun.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/beach_coconut_tree.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Coconut Tree on Beach\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>On the other hand, you may sometimes end up with more airflow than you would like. Beaches can be very windy, especially in some locations. So this should be one of your prime considerations when you&apos;re selecting a site for setup.</p>\n<p>If you can get at least partial shelter from the wind, that will go a long way toward a more comfortable and enjoyable day.</p>\n<h3>Consider selecting a site with a bit of natural shade</h3>\n<p>The whole point of a canopy tent is to give you some shade while you are on the beach. Because of its design, however, it does the best job of this when the sun is at its zenith. In the early morning and late afternoon, the sun will be below the level of the canopy. Check out a list of the some of the coolest <a href=\"https://www.fodors.com/news/photos/10-beautiful-beaches-where-the-sun-wont-completely-murder-you\" target=\"_blank\">beaches with natural shade</a>, we recommend checking some of these out :)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you know roughly what path the sun will be traveling during the hours you are at the beach, you can try to pick a site which will offer some natural shade during the hours of the day when your canopy cannot provide adequate coverage.</p>\n<h3>Walk a little further if it means escaping the crowds</h3>\n<p>There are some beaches where privacy is out of the question, like crowded city shores. But at quite a few other beaches, how much privacy you will have depends largely on how far you&apos;re willing to walk.</p>\n<p>That does not necessarily mean you need to carry your tent and other supplies clear across the beach, crossing miles of sand.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly often, it might mean walking just ten or fifteen minutes farther than the average beachgoer. Oftentimes, if there is a minor obstacle in the way (i.e. a protruding outcrop which forces you to wade in a foot of water to get to the other side), that is often enough to deter the crowds (a lot of people don&rsquo;t want to get their feet wet, even at the beach).</p>\n<p>As a bonus, that outcrop can give you added privacy, since it shields off your view of the crowds. That just leaves you with the serenity of a comparatively less-crowded stretch of sand.</p>\n<p>On top of that, the outcrop might be able to fill two of the other functions we&rsquo;ve talked about. For at least part of the day, it might provide you with additional shade. It might also do a good job of screening out a significant amount of wind.</p>\n<h3>Consider kids and pets</h3>\n<p>If you have children or pets with you on your beach outing, think about their safety as well as their fun when you are choosing a spot. With children, for example, you should stay away from spots where there are sharp, slippery rocks jutting out in or near the water. With a small dog, stay away from super windy spots where your dog could blow into the water.</p>\n<h3>Pick somewhere picturesque</h3>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least, choose a scenic spot for your tent where you can take in the best of the scenery throughout the day. This is one of the great benefits of canopy tents over other types of tents which have side walls. You get to continue to look out and admire beautiful views from every angle while enjoying the shade.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: The Best Experience With Your Canopy Tent on the Beach Relies on Picking the Best Site to Set Up</strong></p>\n<p>We have now gone over some of the most important considerations when choosing a spot to set up your canopy tent on the beach. It may take you a few extra minutes to get away from the crowds and to pick a spot which is sheltered from wind and sun, but it will be well worth it over the hours ahead as you enjoy yourself to the fullest.</p>','/img/beach_location.jpg','Misc'),('christmas-beach-tent',17,'Finding a gift for that hard to shop for family member','We talk about why a baby beach tent could be a great gift for a new parent in your family.','Kenneth Huebsch','December 16, 2017','<p>It’s that time again, the holiday season. December is supposed to be a time of happiness and joy. But the fact is that it can actually be a pretty stressful month because you have a limited time to complete your Christmas shopping. There are certain members of my family that are very difficult to shop for. I have sisters with very specific fashion tastes, a brother-in-law who only likes high-end merchandise, and a father who seems to have everything on the planet already. Every year it is difficult to find the right gift for these hard-to-shop-for family members. I always want to put a smile on the face of the person opening the gift, so December can get pretty stressful for me. There are always a couple family members who I just can’t manage to find the right gift for, and as the days move to mid and late December, it really starts to become crunch time.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that I usually wind up finding something at the last minute for many of these people, I have actually done pretty well in the past and have given some pretty good gifts. As hopeless as I may feel at some points, it always winds up working out.\nThe reason that I am writing this article is because I wanted to share a success story with you. I am hoping that this gift success story might cause you to think outside of box and consider a new product. Or maybe an idea will pop into your head that will wind up being a perfect gift for a hard-to-shop-for person on your list!</p>\n<h4>Baby Beach Tent</h4>\n<p>Last year I was struggling to find the right gift for my sister. She has a young child, though, which opened up some doors for me in terms of gifts. I could shop for a parenting related gift now. In an effort to try to identify a good potential gift, I thought back to some recent conversations that I had with my sister. I remembered her mentioning that she was going to the beach this coming summer, so I did some research on products that will make it easier for a parent to take a baby or toddler to the beach. I noticed a common theme among many of the products that were mentioned. Most of the products were intended to protect the baby from the sun. A baby or toddler’s skin is soft, new, and extremely vulnerable to sunburn. As we age, the outer layer of our skin hardens and becomes more resistant so sun exposure. But, baby skin needs protected because it is new and susceptible to burning.</p>\n<p>While researching within the category of sun protection, I found myself interested in baby beach tents. The <a href=\"/best-beach-tents\">best baby beach tents</a> are made with high quality UPF 50+ polyester, which reflects ultraviolet radiation and protects the baby. UPF stands for Ultraviolet Protection Factor and is a measurement of the amount of UV rays that the material will block. UPF 50+ is the highest rating for any of the baby tents that I saw and will block at least 98% of the ultraviolet rays that come into contact with the material. In addition to blocking radiation, baby sun tents also provide a shady area for a baby or toddler to play during the day. It can get hot at the beach in the direct sunlight, and it can be uncomfortable for a baby to be in direct sunlight for too long. Beach shelters provide a cool escape for a child to play sheltered from direct sunlight.</p>\n<p>Beach tents are portable and convenient. This is important for trips to the beach because it always seems like you have more stuff than you can carry when you finally make the trek from your parking spot to the beach. A pop up beach tent weighs less than 8 pounds and folds into a carry bag that can easily be slung and carried over a shoulder. Set up and tear down is simple. It takes less than 30 seconds to set up a baby beach tent. The best beach tents are able to be set up by simply pulling a drawstring, which expands the frame and opens the tent. This is convenient when you are at the beach with your baby because when you get to the beach your toddler is going to want to explore and run around. The last thing that you want to have to deal with is loose tent poles and a complex setup process.</p>\n<p>Baby sun shades are also great because they have a privacy wall. The floor of a sun shelter extends in front of the tent into a patio-like area. This has two purposes. First it provides a barrier from the sand in front of the tent which is nice for playing. But the second reason is that the oversized floor is cut in a way that when it is folded up, it completely seals off the opening to the tent. By zipping or clipping the floor up, you are able to create a closed private area inside the tent. This is perfect for feeding or changing your baby.</p>\n<p>Beach tents are also nice products for adults spending a day at beach without a child. Sun shelters are about 4 feet tall, which is the perfect size to sit under in a beach chair. If the sun gets too strong and you want a break, you can move your chair under the shade and enjoy a few minutes of cooler temperatures. 4 feet tall by 7 feet wide is also perfect cooler size. We like putting a cooler underneath the beach tent to keep it shaded from the sun. We can use the cooler as a table and leave our drinks on top of the cooler. Since it is all shaded from the sun, drinks stay nice and cool while you’re relaxing. The other benefit of keeping your cooler under a beach tent is that it shelters your drinks from nosy eyes. This is important if you decide you want to sip on some adult drinks that might not be allowed at the beach. Wait, I didn’t just condone that!</p>\n<p>Whenever you go down to the actual water, you have the ability to put all of your valuables inside the tent and close the privacy wall. This will deter potential thieves from stealing your belongings. You even have the option of putting a little lock through the zippers, which will ensure that nobody can unzip your tent and get to your stuff. Just make sure you don’t lose the key!</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>In addition to all of the wonderful benefits of a beach tent that I listed above, the most appealing characteristic to me was affordability. Beach tents are priced in a range that makes them a good gift. They make a great present because they actually provide value. The parents that you give a beach tent to will thank you on Christmas day. But they will also thank you that summer when they use it and see how much easier it made their life at the beach. Hopefully this article taught you a little about beach tents and why they can make a good gift for a new parent. We wish you good luck while shopping this holiday season. And have a Merry Christmas!</p>','/img/christmas-ornaments.jpg','Beach'),('clean-mold-from-canopy-fabric',76,'How to Clean Mold Off a Canopy Top: Tips and Tricks','Discover how to remove mold or mildew from your canopy tent canvas quickly and easily.','Davis Nickey','May 29, 2022','<p>If you&apos;ve ever had a mold problem, you know how difficult it can be to get rid of. Mold spores can travel through the air and attach themselves to any surface, which is why it&apos;s important to take care of any mold issues as soon as they arise. In this blog post, we will discuss how to clean mold off a <a href=\"/\">canopy tent</a> top. We will provide tips and tricks that will help you get the job done quickly and efficiently!</p>\n<p>Most people don&apos;t think about mold until they see it growing somewhere in their homes. Mold is a <a href=\"https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/types-of-mold/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">type of fungus</a> that thrives in moist or humid conditions and can be found on a variety of surfaces, including wood, paper, and cloth. Mildew is the most common type of mold found on canopies and is usually caused by high humidity or <a href=\"/blog/rain-camping-without-waterproof-tent\">wet conditions</a>. Canopy tops are especially susceptible to mold growth because they&apos;re often in storage during the <a href=\"/blog/winter-camping-guide\">winter months</a> which are often humid environments. Mold can form on different types of <a href=\"/blog/tent-materials\">canopy materials</a>, but some tend to allow bacteria to adhere more quickly and easily. Cladosporium and Alternaria are other types of allergen mold that can be found on canopies.</p>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/mold-on-canopy-fabric.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Mold on Canopy Fabric\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n  \n<p>Mildew isn&apos;t harmful or toxic, but it can cause allergic reactions in some people. In addition, mold can damage the <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">material of your canopy</a>, so it&apos;s important to remove it as soon as you notice it. Common allergic reactions include sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and difficulty breathing. If you experience any of these symptoms after coming into contact with mold, you should see a doctor immediately.</p>\n<h2>If you have a mold problem on your canopy tent fabric, here are some tips to get rid of it:</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Start by taking the canopy down and setting it in an open area. Expand and inspect the material so that you can see all of the moldy areas.</li>\n    <li>Be sure to use gloves to protect your hands from the mold and mildew, as well as the solution that we will be mixing.</li>\n    <li>Mix equal parts of water and vinegar in a spray bottle. This natural solution will help to kill the mold spores and prevent them from spreading. Spray the material and let it sit for approximately 45 seconds so the material absorbs the solution.</li>\n    <li>Next, use a soft brush or cloth to scrub the affected area. Be sure to scrub gently so as not to damage the material.</li>\n    <li>Once you&apos;ve scrubbed the area, rinse it with clean water and allow it to air dry.</li>\n    <li>If the mold problem is severe, you may need to repeat this process a few times. However, if the issue persists, you may need to consult a professional or look into purchasing a new canopy awning for your tent frame.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the water and vinegar solution doesn&apos;t generate the desired outcome, we have also found that 1 cup of <a href=\"https://homesteady.com/12421215/lemon-juice-mold-removal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lemon juice</a> mixed with a gallon of hot water can be used as an effective mold removal solution as well. Simply mix the ingredients together and use a sponge or brush to scrub the affected area. As with the vinegar solution, be sure to rinse the area afterward and allow it to air dry completely.</p>\n<p>We recommend avoiding the use of bleach as it can damage the fabric of your canopy and discolor the material if it&apos;s not used correctly. If you must use bleach, be sure to dilute it with water and always test it on a small area first.</p>\n<h3>How to prevent mold from forming on your canopy tent</h3>\n<p>Prevent mold build-up by storing your canopy in a dry, well-ventilated area when it&apos;s not in use. If you live in an area with high humidity, be sure to open up the canopy and allow it to air. Using a humidifier in a garage or storage space will also help to keep the air dry and reduce the risk of mold growth.</p>\n<h3>Do certain colors help to show fewer mold spots?</h3>\n<p>Lighter colors tend to show mold easier than darker colored materials, however, no color is completely resistant. If you&apos;re concerned about mold growth, be sure to inspect your canopy regularly and take care of any issues as soon as they arise.</p>\n<p>We hope you found these tips and tricks helpful!

The <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">150D polyester</a> canopy also is rugged enough to stand up to light to moderate wind.</p>\n<p>Be aware though that powerful gusts or high winds can easily compromise both the fabric and the supports. You should not have the tent erected in such conditions, and you should be careful even with moderate winds. How do you know how much wind is too much? The best recommendation is to play it safe. Get started by using the tent on days which are relatively windless, and work your way up to light winds. This should give you more of a feel for what the tent can tolerate. That way you are less likely to overestimate its ability to withstand moderate to strong gusts. We highly suggest purchasing some kind of accessory to <a href=\"/blog/canopy-weights\">keep the canopy firmly on the ground</a> during windy conditions. Stakes, weight bags, or tie downs are typically the best option in doing this.</p>\n<p>Why do some buyers say that a tent like this can withstand moderate gusts, but others say it cannot? Much depends on how effectively you stake your tent when you set it up, so take a few extra minutes if you need to in order to make sure that the tent is as secure as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/coleman_logo.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Coleman Logo\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Transport and Setup</h3>\n<p>Like many competing products, this one comes with a carry bag which is compact enough that you can stow it inside your vehicle trunk. The bag has wheels as well, so you can pull it to your site and back with ease. There are some nice features involved with setup and the tent was designed so that you can set it up within just three minutes using a simple three-step process.</p>\n<p>You never need to raise your arms above your head during setup, thanks to the way the telescoping poles were built. This may make it a good option for someone with shoulder, back or neck problems who cannot reach up high without worsening those issues, or for people unable to life weight over their head.</p>\n<p>Another cool setup feature is a set of <a href=\"https://www.coleman.com/coleman-shelter-technology.html?cgid=coleman\" target=\"_blank\">Comfort Grip push-button release levers</a> that are proprietary to Colement. These prevent your fingers from getting pinched as you adjust your pop-up tent to your satisfaction.</p>\n<h3>Aesthetics</h3>\n<p>Overall, the tent has an aesthetically pleasing appearance, especially with its hexagonal shape. The colors are a neutral ivory with a coffee-colored trim which the majority of buyers should find agreeable. The downside is that these are the only colors available, so there is no way to express your personality through your tent if you prefer something bold and bright.</p>\n<h3>Standout Features and Accessories</h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve gone over most of the exciting features which make the Coleman Instant Pop-Up Canopy Tent a worthy purchase, but here are a couple more which add to its value.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2-way roof vents. These provide air circulation through the roof. Doing so increases comfort underneath the shelter while also offering much more stability. It is harder for the wind to grab the canopy from underneath and knock the tent off balance or rip the fabric.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The poles are footed. This helps you to anchor them, also increasing the tent&rsquo;s overall stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The tent protects you from UV rays. With <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/sun-protection.html\" target=\"_blank\">50+ UV Guard sun protection</a>, you are shielded from some of the damage of the rays streaming down from overhead. Don&rsquo;t forget though that this is an open-sided tent, meaning sunlight is still striking you directly from the sides. Apply sunscreen as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Coleman is generally great at responding to inquiries from customers. The team is knowledgeable and friendly, with agents eager to help.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pros of the Coleman Instant Pop-Up Canopy Tent:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>While the tent&rsquo;s poles are spaced in such a way that the space underneath is 10&rsquo; x 10&rsquo;, the shade actually extends to 13&rsquo; x 13&rsquo;.</li>\n<li>Easy setup features protect your fingers and reduce strain on your neck, shoulders, and back as you are erecting the tent.</li>\n<li>Footed poles and canopy vents boost stability.</li>\n<li>Durable materials and rugged design can stand up to light to moderate winds.</li>\n<li>You are protected from harmful UV rays by your canopy tent.</li>\n<li>A wheeled carrying bag comes with your purchase for easy, convenient transport.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons of the Coleman Instant Pop-Up Canopy Tent:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The only color option is the ivory with the coffee-colored trim.</li>\n<li>High winds or strong gusts will damage this pop-up canopy tent. That is pretty much expected with most canopy tents, however.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>With Its More Expansive Shade and Its Easy Setup Features, the Coleman Instant Pop-Up Canopy Tent May Be Just What You Need</p>\n<p>While the Coleman Instant Pop-Up Canopy Tent shares many features in common with other canopy tents in the same general price range, it does stand out in a few respects. Its hexagonal shape and wider canopy offer fuller shade. Its special easy setup features which keep fingers from being pinched while reducing back and neck tension make it not only simple to set up, but also stress-free. Its susceptibility to high winds isn&rsquo;t a unique drawback among canopy tents&mdash;this is par the course. So the only other significant disadvantage is the lack of color choices. But if you like the ivory and coffee, you are good to go.</p>\n<p>So if you are still in search of the ideal tent for home or vacation use, think about trying the Coleman Instant Pop-Up Canopy Tent. Its extra shade and ease-of-use make it an excellent option.</p>','/img/coleman-instant-canopy-review.jpg','Review'),('cool-cabana-beach-canopy-review',33,'A first hand experience and review of a Cool Cabana Sunshade beach canopy','A frequent reader of our site put the lightweight Cool Cabana pop up beach canopy to the test during a West Coast vacation.','Eric Warsaw','February 5, 2019','<p>Recently I decided to purchase a pop-up canopy tent for a beach vacation. My friend recommended that I check out the <a href=\"https://coolcabanas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cool Cabanas UPF-50 Sunshade</a>. After conducting some research online, I discovered that it looked like one of the better, lightweight, options for replacing my old pop-up canopy tent.</p>\n<p>So I went ahead with the purchase and brought the beach tent with me on my trip. The Cool Cabanas UPF-50 Sunshade is easy to set up and offers great stability if you do so properly. I decided that I would go ahead and write a review for the site based on my experiences. I will start by going over the specifications and some of the key features which make this portable beach canopy stand out. I will then tell you a bit more about my own experiences and some of the pros and cons of the product before giving a final verdict. If youre in the market for a new <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">pop up beach canopy</a> tent, hopefully this review will lead to in the right direction to see if its a good option for you.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n		<img src=\"/img/coolcabana-beach-canopy.jpeg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Cool Cabanas Beach Canopy\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Specs</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>Weighs just 6 pounds out of the bag, 7 pounds in the bag</li>\n	<li>Measures only 99x12x12cm when collapsed</li>\n	<li>When expanded, measures 2.85m (9ft 5in) diagonally, 1.88m (6ft 2in) to the peak of the roof, and 1.56m (5ft 2in) to the edge of the roof</li>\n	<li>Features UPF 50 cotton poly canvas</li>\n	<li>8 pockets measuring 16cm X 11cm</li>\n	<li>Comes in several colors and designs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<h4>Fast and Easy Setup</h4>\n<p>You should find it a breeze to get set up with this Cool Cabanas Sunshade. It only takes a few steps, and the sturdiness of the parts helps you erect the tent even with a strong wind on the beach. Collapsing it is just as easy.</p>\n<h4>Rugged Enough to Withstand Strong Winds</h4>\n<p>This is a tent which can take whatever nature can throw at it. Obviously it should not be exposed to gale force winds&mdash;it was built to be taken out on breezy but pleasant days. It can get to be pretty windy even on beautiful, clear days where I live, though, so this was a very important consideration for me. I am glad to say that the tent met and exceeded my expectations in this regard (more on that shortly).</p>\n<h4>Impressively Compact and Lightweight</h4>\n<p>If you have to do a bit of walking to get to the perfect spot, no worries&mdash;this sunshade will not weigh you down too much, nor is it overly unwieldy.</p>\n<h3>My Experience With the Cool Cabanas UPF-50 Sunshade</h3>\n<p>When I mention I went out on a &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; with my new sunshade, I should clarify that I drove up the <a href=\"/blog/winter-beaches\">Oregon coast</a> where I live a few hours and set up on one of my favorite beaches. I love the solitude up here and the stunning scenery. But the Oregon coast is really, <em>really </em>windy in many spots&mdash;including the one where I ultimately pitched the tent. So I was more than a little nervous about how it would perform.</p>\n<p>Backing up a bit, I didn&rsquo;t have a terribly long walk from where I parked to where I set up, but it would have been fatiguing had the sunshade been heavy. Thankfully, I wasn&rsquo;t even winded when I got to my site, and I didn&rsquo;t need to stop and rest at any point along the way. This is because of the lightweight design of the sun shelter, which weighs in at only about 6 pounds. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I was doing, but the setup process was pretty intuitive, and it didn&rsquo;t take me long at all to get the tent up.</p>\n<p>I loved having such a luxurious amount of shade, and found the pockets <em>very </em>helpful for keeping my smartphone and wallet out of the sand. As for the wind, thankfully it actually wasn&rsquo;t too bad for most of my stay, but it got pretty crazy at times. I&rsquo;d tense up each time, waiting for the sunshade to collapse, but it held its own.</p>\n<p>By the end of my trip, I didn&rsquo;t spot any obvious signs of wear on my Cool Cabanas Sunshade. Packing it up and carrying it back to my vehicle was just as easy as the initial setup.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li>You can get this tent set up quickly and easily.</li>\n	<li>The pockets are incredibly handy.</li>\n	<li>Even if you are going to erect this tent on a beach with strong winds, you should find that it can hold up well (note that this style of tent does not shield you from the wind).</li>\n	<li>It is compact and lightweight enough for one person to carry to and from a site without any hassles.</li>\n	<li>The selection of colors and patterns available is awesome. There is something to suit every personality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li>The tent is a bit small. This isn&rsquo;t a problem for me since I am using it by myself, but I imagine that if you wanted to sit under here with a friend or two, you might feel like it is a bit cramped. It isn&rsquo;t ideal for standing up either.</li>\n	<li>This tent doesn&rsquo;t really do much to <a href=\"/blog/finding-the-right-beach-tent\">protect your skin</a> when the sun dips below a certain point in the sky&mdash;but that is true with this style of tent regardless of the product or manufacturer you choose.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Verdict</h3>\n<p>The Cool Cabanas UPF-50 Sunshade offers fantastic ease-of-use, stability, and convenience.</p>\n<p>Does the Cool Cabanas have a few drawbacks? Sure. I wouldn&rsquo;t have said no to a bit more height, and the pop-up canopy tent design has some intrinsic limitations when the sun is low in the sky.</p>\n<p>But all in all, I have been very satisfied with my purchase of this tent. I havent yet tried out the <a href=\"http://www.easygocabana.com/\" target=\"_blank\">6x6 EasyGo Cabana</a>, but I would be interested to see how these compare side by side since they seem to have a similar design. Carrying it to and from my site and setting it up and taking it were very easy. It didn&rsquo;t waver in the face of strong winds, and it gave me plenty of shade during the brightest, hottest hours of the day. Based on my experiences with it so far, I expect it to work out great as a long-term <a href=\"/blog/types-of-sun-shelters\">beach shade solution</a>, and can give the Cool Cabanas UPF-50 Sunshade a solid recommendation as a top rated beach canopy.</p>','/img/coolcabana-on-beach.jpg','Review,Beach'),('covid-and-local-governments',64,'How Towns Are Handling COVID','Here are some things towns are doing to help fight the spread of COVID.','Richard Benjamins','January 10, 2021',' <p>National policies have had a massive impact on the spread of coronavirus. But did you know that local governments have also come to play a crucial role when it comes to containing and mitigating the threat of COVID-19?</p>\n\n <p>Indeed, in countries that are ill-prepared on a national level, the steps taken in local communities to manage coronavirus are even more vital in maintaining public health and safety.</p>\n\n <p>What are towns and cities doing to protect residents and visitors? Let’s go over some common measures that public officials are taking at a local level. </p>\n\n <p>But first, it is important to mention that there is a huge spectrum when it comes to responses. Here are some of the factors that influence how one town or city handles COVID-19 compared to another:</p>\n\n <ul>\n 	<li>The geographical location of the city or town.</li>\n 	<li>Various aspects of the community’s economy.</li>\n 	<li>The infrastructure of the town or city with respect to transportation, healthcare, and communication.</li>\n 	<li>Local population demographics.</li>\n 	<li>Inequalities in the town or city.</li>\n 	<li>What public officials are in power and what their political alignments and goals are.</li>\n 	<li>Resources and supplies immediately available and access to additional supplies. </li>\n 	<li>The town or city’s budget.</li>\n </ul>\n\n <p>Now, let’s go over some steps that many towns and cities around the globe have taken to manage COVID-19.</p>\n\n <h3>1. Implementing travel restrictions.</h3>\n\n <p>Many cities and towns have put travel restrictions into effect—or at least stern warnings. In the US, travel advisories have urged citizens to avoid all but essential movement in and out of cities and towns.</p>\n\n <p>In other cities around the world, travel restrictions have been much stricter. In Wuhan, for example, it was impossible to come or go from the city during the travel lockdown.</p>\n\n <h3>2. Sanitization of public transportation systems.</h3>\n\n <p>Minimizing the threat of coronavirus spreading through mass transit systems has been a high priority around the globe.</p>\n\n <p>Different cities have taken different steps to fight the virus. New York City invested in hundreds of UV lamps for its subway and bus system. Istanbul mobilized a 40-vehicle fleet to continuously sanitize public transit and other spaces.</p>\n\n <h3>3. Support for cycling.</h3>\n\n <p>A lot of people don’t want to walk in crowds, but they also don’t want to use public transit to commute anymore. Packing everyone into private automobiles isn’t necessarily a solution though in crowded urban centers. So what are cities doing to help?</p>\n\n <p>Some cities are embracing cycling. In New York City, petitions have circulated to add in more bike lanes, and the mayor himself has encouraged bicycle commuting.</p>\n\n <p>That being said, in other cities, cycling has been frowned upon since the pandemic started to the point where officials have imposed fines.</p>\n\n <h3>4. Mobile testing sites and infirmaries.</h3>\n\n <p>To make it as safe and easy as possible to get tested, some cities have been setting up mobile testing sites under canopy tents.</p>\n\n  <div class=\"row\">\n 	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n 		<img src=\"/img/walkup-covid-testing.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Mobile covid testing tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n 	</div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n <p>These <a href=\"/best-10x20-pop-up-canopy\">large canopy tents</a> feature openings so that it is possible to drive through. Their pop-up design makes them fast and easy for medical workers to set up where they are needed most. They have walled-off sections where staff can store equipment and work.</p>\n\n <p>We are also seeing pop-up mobile infirmary tents in locations where there is an urgent need for on-site care.</p>\n\n <p>Finally, small pop-up canopy tents are being used as hand-washing stations at a variety of locations.</p>\n\n <h3>5. Closing schools.</h3>\n\n <p>In many cities and towns, schools have shut down for periods of time during lockdowns to protect students, faculty, and families from the spread of the virus.</p>\n\n <p>Students have attended school online instead of in person in these locales.</p>\n\n <h3>6. Support services.</h3>\n\n <p>Cities have been providing a wide variety of digital support services to residents during the pandemic.</p>\n\n <p>In Boston and New York City, for example, public schools have been giving free Chromebooks to students who do not own their own devices.</p>\n\n <p>Meanwhile, Helsinki has worked with a variety of organizations to bring personalized food and pharmacy services to residents age 70 and above. </p>\n\n <p>Additionally, as explained by <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/sustainablecities/functional-citys-response-covid-19-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank</a>, Helsinki has “developed digital cultural services for its population in its aim to maintain a stimulating urban life and to reduce the mental health impacts from social distancing and isolation.”</p>\n\n <h3>7. Social distancing.</h3>\n\n <p>Speaking of isolation, cities, towns and counties have been under different local restrictions during lockdowns this year.</p>\n\n <p>For example, Multnomah County, where Portland is located, has put caps on how many people can eat in restaurants at a time, and has set an 11 pm restaurant and bar curfew.</p>\n\n <p>The county also set a 50% capacity limit for farmers’ markets and retail stores, but closed indoor entertainment facilities. </p>\n\n <p>Additionally, group gatherings were capped at six people and two households maximum.</p>\n\n <p>This is an example of a high-risk county. Residents in smaller, more isolated towns have often faced looser restrictions. But at times, lockdown requirements have applied state-wide, so that even those in lower-risk communities have had to follow similar protocols. </p>\n\n <h3>8. Contact tracing.</h3>\n\n <p>Depending on the location of outbreaks, county, state and national governments all have played a role in contact tracing. But cities and towns also have contributed to the necessary tracking of coronavirus data.</p>\n\n <p>How Different Cities and Towns Have Responded to COVID-19 Reveals Much</p>\n\n <p>With such varied responses from different towns and cities around the world, coronavirus has offered many lessons in urban infrastructure. </p>\n\n <p>We have had a chance to find out what does and doesn’t work in terms of preparedness and adaptive responses.</p>\n\n <p>We can make the most of a bad situation by taking these lessons to heart. Cities and towns that have struggled to maintain the health and financial well-being of residents can start taking cues from those that have kept residents safe.</p>\n\n <p>Hopefully we will overcome coronavirus, but it is pretty much a guarantee at this point that the future holds more threats in store.</p>\n\n <p>Let us hope that cities and towns will be more robust in the wake of COVID-19, and more prepared for the next pandemic or other wide-scale crisis.</p> ','/img/drive-through-covid-testing-site.jpg','Misc'),('covid-beach-vacation-tips',60,'Beach Vacation Tips in Covid Times','With the proper precautions, you should still be able to enjoy a beach vacation during the covid pandemic.','Wade McCormick','August 16, 2020','<p>While many of us have spent the better part of 2020 quarantined in our homes, you might be hoping to get out and enjoy the summer weather while it is here.</p>\n\n<p>A beach vacation during coronavirus does entail some risk. But by following the recommendations below, you can help to minimize your risk and that of others while you&apos;re enjoying some sand and surf.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>1. Vacation at isolated beaches.</h4>\n\n<p>The single biggest thing you can do to protect yourself is to be selective of your vacation spot.</p>\n\n<p>There is a world of difference between going to a crowded <a href=\"/blog/ocean-city-nj\">beach in New Jersey</a> or <a href=\"/blog/virginia-beach-guide\">Virginia</a> versus heading to a relatively secluded beach in a state like Oregon or Maine.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/crowded-beach.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Crowded Beach\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n\n<p>In fact, the open airflow in these locations could actually make the beach one of the safer places to spend time outdoors so long as you are relatively isolated.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>2. Choose spots far away from others, even if you have to walk a little further to set up.</h4>\n\n<p>A lot of people do not want to do a lot of walking before they set up on the beach. So, consider doing a little bit of extra walking yourself. By doing so, sometimes, you can find a relatively <a href=\"/blog/choosing-beach-canopy-location\">secluded spot</a> even if you are at a city beach.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>3. Follow all rules at the beach you are visiting.</h4>\n\n<p>Every beach has specific rules for COVID-19. Some involve limiting crowds by restricting how many people are in a group. Others concern activities, like not being allowed to sunbathe. Still others set limits on what you can bring (i.e. coolers).</p>\n\n<p>Look up the <a href=\"/blog/beach-regulations\">rules for the beach</a> in question, and follow all of them, whether you understand or agree with them or not.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>4. Choose a spot upwind.</h4>\n\n<p>COVID-19 travels through the air. For that reason, it is better to set up upwind of another person or group on the beach than downwind.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>5. Wear your mask when in close proximity to others.</h4>\n\n<p>If you are way out by yourself on the beach and feel comfortable taking off your mask, that is fine.</p>\n\n<p>But if you are within a short distance of other people, you should wear your mask. Doing so protects others and yourself, and also encourages the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html\" target=\"_blank\">same ethical behavior</a> from your fellow beachgoers.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>6. Consider yourself potentially contaminated when you are at the beach, as you do anywhere else outdoors.</h4>\n\n<p>Even if you are at a sparsely crowded beach, just stepping outside of the relatively controlled, contained environment of your home elevates your risk.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly true if you stop at other locations along the way, or if there is any coronavirus contaminating your vehicle that you might not be aware is present.</p>\n\n<p>For that reason, while you&apos;re at the beach, you should never lose sight of the fact that you could potentially be contaminated.</p>\n\n<p>So, you need to keep your hands away from your face, and try not to touch more surfaces than is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Also, keep in mind that rinsing your hands in the ocean water will not necessarily kill any viruses that are on your hands, as you have no soap.</p>\n\n<p>Contamination from the ocean water is unlikely, but no one knows if it is impossible at this point. So, avoid swimming in crowded water.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>7. Set up a canopy tent with sidewall attachments.</h4>\n\n<p>Consider bringing a canopy tent with you to the beach during COVID-19. You can set it up in such a way as to provide yourself with a little bit more protection.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n    	<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ibcd4Z\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n            <img src=\"/img/side-wall.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Canopy Tent Sun Wall\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n        </a>\n        <p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click on image to see sun wall prices on Amazon</small></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>For example, you can attach <a href=\"/blog/canopy-tent-accessories\">one or more sidewalls</a> to block off some of the air flowing toward you, especially if you are downwind of someone.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this will not stop you from getting coronavirus, but it is at least a little bit of extra protection.</p>\n\n<p>Should you put up sidewalls on every side of your tent? That may not be the best idea, as you would not want any coronavirus to get trapped inside.</p>\n\n<p>It may be wisest to leave at least one wall open so that there is still some circulation of air between the interior of the tent and the beach at large.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>8. Bring hand sanitizer with you.</h4>\n\n<p>As when you are traveling anywhere else outside of your house, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/qa-consumers-hand-sanitizers-and-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\">you should take hand sanitizer</a> on your trip to the beach.</p>\n\n<p>Use it as you are getting in and out of your automobile (i.e. on the steering wheel and door handle), and wipe down other surfaces and objects that you touch.</p>\n\n<p>If you touch anything that you think might be contaminated in your environment, use it to try and disinfect your hands before handling other objects.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>9. Be aware that public facilities may be either unclean or unavailable. </h4>\n\n<p>In some locations, public facilities like bathrooms and showers may be open, while in others they may be closed.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, if they are closed, you will need to have a backup plan in case you need to use the bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>What if they are open? You should strongly consider avoiding using them if at all possible anyway, as they could be a hotbed for the virus.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>10. Decontaminate when you come back home.</h4>\n\n<p>After you get back from the beach, you should follow the same decontamination protocols that you do when you get back home from any other location.</p>\n\n<p>Even though you are much less likely to have picked up COVID-19 on an isolated beach then you would be at the grocery store, it is always better to be safe than sorry.</p>\n\n<p>Taking Proper Precautions Can Help You Stay Safe at the Beach During COVID-19</p>\n\n<p>You have a number of helpful recommendations now to protect yourself from coronavirus while you are on a beach vacation this year.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, there is no reason to take any unnecessary risks with your life or that of your family members.</p>\n\n<p>So, avoid outings at crowded beaches, and stick with more remote locations where you will have plenty of room to yourself to enjoy the beach in relative safety and seclusion.</p>','/img/masks-at-beach.jpg','Beach'),('covid-tailgating',63,'Tailgating During COVID','If you decide you want to tailgate during COVID times, follow these suggestions to stay safe.','Jon Bender','December 19, 2020','<p>Tailgating during the COVID-19 pandemic is a risky thing to do—there is no getting around that fact. Indeed, many colleges have put a strict ban on tailgate parties in order to try and curb the spread of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>But here’s the thing—tailgating is arguably safer—assuming reasonable social distances and hygiene practices are observed—than a lot of other social activities. Why? Because tailgating is an outdoor activity.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> explains, “In one study of more than 7,300 cases in China, just one was connected to outdoor transmission.”\n\n<p>The outdoors is well-ventilated. For that reason, going to a tailgating party is probably a lot safer than, say, eating and watching a game indoors in a restaurant or sports bar.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to attend a tailgate party, you do need to limit your contact with other participants and take other basic steps to limit potential exposure. Here are some tips to help you do that.</p>\n\n<h4>1.	Wear a mask, and stay away from anyone who doesn’t.</h4>\n\n<p>Many of the rules for safe tailgating are the same as they are for doing pretty much anything else in public during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>That means that you should be wearing a mask at all times. You should only remove it when you are eating or drinking.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, you should only attend events where everybody else is following the same protocol. But if you do see anyone not wearing a mask, keep as far away from that person as you can.</p>\n\n<h4>2.	Avoid being vocal, and stay away from others who are vocal.</h4>\n\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/attending-sports.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a>, the CDC says that tailgaters should be “discouraged from yelling, chanting, or singing.”</p>\n\n<p>This makes sense, being as doing these things increases your chances of infecting someone or becoming infected. That is even true if you are all wearing masks.<p>\n\n<p>Focus on other ways of showing your support for your team., i.e. visually instead of audibly.</p>\n\n<h4>3.	Bring your own supplies, and do not share supplies.</h4>\n\n<p>Traditionally, tailgaters share food, drinks and other supplies with each other. But you cannot do that safely during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>So, you should make sure that you have all of the supplies you will need, including food and drinks. Do not accept these things from other people, even if they are offered, and do not share your own items with anybody else, even if you believe you are not infected.</p>\n\n<h4>4.	Have your hand sanitizer ready to go.</h4>\n\n<p>Even though you should be able to limit your contact with items that are not your own pretty effectively, you should still have plenty of hand sanitizer ready.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to use it liberally throughout the day anytime you think you might need it (i.e., after handing takeout boxes, bottles, or so forth, or after you return from the bathroom). Disinfectant wipes are also useful to have on hand.</p>\n\n<h4>5.	Try to keep parties local.</h4>\n\n<p>he safest tailgating parties will be those that are small and local. Thankfully, with college sports, that should be easy.</p>\n\n<p>But you may want to avoid tailgating parties at major stadiums for professional sports, as those might attract people from distant parts of the country. Travelers may carry coronavirus from regions where the virus is more widespread.</p>\n\n<h4>6.	Stay in your own zone.</h4>\n\n<p>The organizers for the party you attend may or may not draw lines on the pavement to designate zones for each vehicle/family.</p>\n\n<p>Whether they do or not, it is important to stay in your own area. And if there are no such visual cues, you might want to consider drawing your own with chalk, especially if you have kids with you who might need a reminder not to wander into other peoples’ space.</p>\n\n<p>7.	Find ways to interact that don’t entail breaking social distancing rules.</p>\n\n<p>If you have friends at the party, you may want to keep in touch with each other on your mobile devices even if you are in shouting range. Remember, it is important to avoid shouting, so it is better just to type or video chat with one another.</p>\n\n<h4>8.	Set up a canopy tent for your group.</h4>\n\n<p>One of the best recommendations for keeping as safe as possible during a tailgating party is to bring a <a href=\"/blog/best-tailgating-canopy\">canopy tent</a> with walls.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbs19.tv/article/sports/ncaa/longhorns/university-texas-austin-tailgaters-find-a-way-around-no-tailgating-rule/269-45f2c180-c192-408f-912d-35c0bd34c216\" target=\"_blank\">CBS reports</a> on how the Horn-Ball Texas Tailgaters found a safer way for fans to enjoy University of Texas at Austin tailgating events.</p>\n\n<p>The article quotes group owner Ryan Lepper explaining, “We put together a proposal that outlined and used Gov. Greg Abbott&apos;s guidelines for the state, Department of State Health Services, and put it into a proposal on how we can do a special event that&apos;s socially responsible.”</p>\n\n<p>The group’s proposal involved the use of canopy tents. Lepper says, “Each tent is a family unit, very similar to like a restaurant. So within that tent that family unit could be within that 6-feet range, but outside of that you must maintain your distance and a mask.\"</p>\n\n<p>The group did receive approval to move forward with the party. While their canopy tents did not include sidewalls (thus functioning largely as visual cues for each household’s zone), one could feasibly choose a tent with sidewalls and set them up so that they form a barrier against the wind. This might provide a little bit of extra protection from participants who are upwind from you.</p>\n\n<h3>Stay Safe Tailgating, and Have Fun</h3>\n\n<p>There is no way to completely eliminate the risk of catching coronavirus when you are at a public event, even an outdoor event like tailgating.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, by following the recommendations above, you can keep your risk of catching the virus or passing it to others to a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Choose events where social distancing rules are strongly encouraged, or organize one yourself, and avoid those where people are not wearing masks or are sharing items or space with other households. Have a great time supporting your team with other fans, and do all you can to stay safe!</p>','/img/covid-tailgating.jpg','Tailgate'),('cross-truss-vs-pyramid',48,'Cross-truss vs. Pyramid Canopy Tent','We explain the structural differences between the two main types of canopy tents available today as well as the pros and cons of each.','Eric Warsaw','August 14, 2019','<p>If you are purchasing a pop-up canopy tent, one of the buying considerations you will need to have in mind as you compare products is the structure of the frame. Two main types of structures are common among pop-up canopy tents. These are called &ldquo;cross-truss&rdquo; and &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; frames.</p>\n<p>To help you figure out which may be most suitable for your needs, let&rsquo;s talk about what these two different types of frames are along with their advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<h3>What is a Pyramid Frame Canopy Tent?</h3>\n<p>It is easiest to explain the different types of canopy tent frames with the help of images. You can see what a pyramid frame looks like in the image below:</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/pyramid-frame.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Cross Trussed Canopy Tent Frame\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>As you can see, there are cross-trusses which provide support across the structure of the square. This helps to reinforce the shape of the tent and reduce the structural weakness which comes with using a square in a tent&rsquo;s design. It would be much harder to deform or collapse this tent by applying force to the corners.</p>\n<p>The name &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; comes from the long supports which start at each of the four corners and then converge to form a raised point in the center. These provide the canopy with its pyramidal shape. Truss supports meanwhile wind around the canopy&rsquo;s perimeter. The majority of pop-up canopy tents feature this frame design.</p>\n<h4>Pros of Pyramid Frames</h4>\n<p>This is a popular type of frame because manufacturing it is affordable. The amount of material required is less for this type of frame than it is for a cross-truss frame. This helps keep the cost down for you as the buyer as well.</p>\n<h4>Cons of Pyramid Frames</h4>\n<p>The principle drawback of a pyramid frame for a pop-up tent concerns the lack of cross-trusses (as you might have guessed already, if you have intuited the function of a cross-truss from its name).</p>\n<p>Looking at the picture, you probably noticed that there are no supports at the level of the square which span across the structure. There is only empty space.</p>\n<p>To picture why this is a structural weakness, imagine that you are able to press against two opposite corners of the tent, pushing them in toward one another (something which could feasibly happen with some wild winds whipping at your tent). The tent would easily fold in half.</p>\n<h4>When Should You Consider a Pyramid Frame Canopy Tent?</h4>\n<p>Even though it is possible to deform a pyramid frame canopy tent, it is not likely to happen under mild conditions. That means that so long as you are not expecting to need to use your tent in moderate to harsh winds, you probably are going to be just fine with a pyramid frame.</p>\n<h3>What is a Cross-Truss Frame Canopy Tent?</h3>\n<p>You probably can more or less picture what a cross-truss frame looks like just based on our discussion above regarding the pyramid frame. But here is a picture for you:</p>\n<div class=\"row\"> <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\"> <img src=\"/img/cross-truss-frame.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Cross Trussed Canopy Tent Frame\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>As you can see, there are cross-trusses which provide support across the structure of the square. This helps to reinforce the shape of the tent and reduce the structural weakness which comes with using a square in a tent&rsquo;s design. It would be much harder to deform or collapse this tent by applying force to the corners.</p>\n<h4>Pros of Cross-Truss Frames</h4>\n<p>There are two structural benefits to cross-trusses. The first is the one which we have just discussed above. It is harder to deform the square by applying force to the corners of your tent.</p>\n<p>The second is that it is also harder to damage the sides of the square. If wind or another force presses on the sides of the tent, the cross-trusses will help counteract those forces, providing support for the frame. With a pyramid shape, you don&rsquo;t have this, and the sides can deform or snap. This may be particularly problematic if the tent is built out of lightweight, flimsy metal to begin with.</p>\n<p>So what you have is a sturdier tent which can stand up to more wear and tear, potentially lasting longer. This longevity may actually make it more cost-efficient given its long-term performance.</p>\n<h4>Cons of Cross-Truss Frames</h4>\n<p>Cross-trusses obviously require extra material, which means three things: more bulk, more weight, and added production costs. That adds to the cost to purchase a cross-truss frame canopy tent as well.</p>\n<p>It is also worth mentioning that a cross-truss frame may be sturdier than a pyramid frame, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can stand up to a whole lot of abuse. Really harsh conditions will still probably damage your tent. So the question you need to ask yourself is whether the extra sturdiness you get is worth the higher price.</p>\n<h5>When Should You Consider a Cross-Truss Frame Canopy Tent?</h5>\n<p>A cross-truss frame canopy tent may be a good idea if you expect your tent to take a few more knocks than it should. For example, if you&rsquo;re regularly hauling around your tent in the back of your truck, it&rsquo;s less likely to be damaged if you have to hit the brakes. Or if you want to use a canopy tent during moderate wind conditions on a regular basis, a cross-truss frame might be worth the extra expense.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>The Ideal Type of Pop-Up Canopy Tent Frame is the One That Fits Your Budget and Needs</p>\n<p>Now that you have had a chance to look at images of both pyramid and cross-truss frames and learn what the difference are between them, you can understand their pros and cons and how they impact the structural integrity, weight and cost of a pop-up canopy tent.</p>\n<p>Which is the right type for you? Think about locations where you will set up your tent. Will it be subject to moderate winds or harsh gusts on a regular basis? Or do you expect to use it only during mild conditions? Is it important to you that the tent be as lightweight as possible? How big a factor is your budget? Head over to our <a href=\"/canopy-tent-buying-guide\">buying guide</a> to check out some more information that might help make your decision easier.</p>\n<p>Once you have weighed all of these considerations, you will be able to decide whether the extra weight and expense of a cross-truss canopy tent is worth it for you, or whether a pyramid canopy tent might better fit your budget and requirements.

While the steel itself is able to stand up to the elements without developing rust, the frame is coated with a white powder finish for additional protection and aesthetic appeal.</p>\n<p>The 150D Oxford fabric used for the canopy itself is reasonably durable, and offers superior protection from the sun&rsquo;s harmful UV rays. As it is water-repellent, it can also shield you a bit from drizzle or rain, so long as it is going straight down.</p>\n<p>One thing to know about this pop up canopy is that it was <em>not </em>designed for harsh winds. It can deal with mild breezes, but if the wind starts picking up, it is wise to take the tent down. Its construction allows for great ease-of-use (see below), but it isn&rsquo;t sturdy enough to withstand high winds.</p>\n<h3>Easy to Transport and Set Up</h3>\n<p>Collapsed, the canopy tent easily fits into the 48in x 6.69in x 6.69in bag which comes with it. The bag has both wheels and a handle, making it effortless to move it from place to place. The handle is rubberized to reduce strain on your hand.</p>\n<p>If there is one standout feature for which this canopy tent should be known, it is how fast and easy it is to get it set up at your site. A single person working alone should be able to erect it within just a couple of minutes. That means you can go right about your business or leisure without a lot of time fussing with the tent.</p>\n<h3>Aesthetics</h3>\n<p>In terms of appearance, this canopy tent is attractive enough, but it doesn&#39;t really stand out in any significant way. You can choose white, black, or blue fabric for the canopy, which is marked with the logo and brand name (CROWN SHADES).</p>\n<h3>Cool Features and Accessories</h3>\n<p>I&#39;ve touched briefly upon some of the features which make this tent worthy of consideration in the specifications, but I would like to elaborate on a few of them here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned before, you can adjust the height of the canopy tent. There are three options to choose from, the highest being 9.19 feet. The best part is that you can adjust the height with just the push of a button&mdash;four, specifically, one on each of the tent&#39;s legs.</li>\n<li>Since this tent comes with everything you need, you are getting excellent value for your money. Along with the frame and canopy, you get the <a href=\"https://www.greenbelly.co/pages/how-to-setup-guylines-and-stake-down-a-tent\" target=\"_blank\">guy ropes and ground stakes necessary for setup</a> along with the previously discussed carrying bag.</li>\n<li>There are some interesting ventilation features incorporated into the tent&#39;s design. Vents in the canopy allow for airflow, increasing comfort and also making it less likely that the wind will pull up on the canopy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Amazing Customer Service</h3>\n<p>Something else which must be mentioned with regards to this canopy tent is that its manufacturer, CROWN SHADES, has a reputation for first-class customer service. Hopefully, you will not have any issues with your tent. But if you do, you can expect the team to be responsive and helpful.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Even though this tent is not sturdy enough for strong winds, it&#39;s made out of sturdy materials which resist rust and provide you with protection from moisture and UV rays.</li>\n<li>The tent is well-ventilated.</li>\n<li>All the accessories which you need for your tent are included with your purchase, including a carrying bag with wheels.</li>\n<li>One person can set this tent up in just a couple of minutes with ease thanks to the central hub system incorporated into the design.</li>\n<li>The height of the tent can be adjusted just by pushing buttons on the legs.</li>\n<li>CROWN SHADES offers excellent customer service under the tent&rsquo;s warranty.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/crown-shades-hub.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Crown Shades setup instructions\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you&#39;re shopping for a tent for high wind conditions, this one is not a suitable choice.</li>\n<li>There are not a lot of extra features. It is a pretty basic canopy tent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The CROWN SHADES folding canopy is the ideal tent if you&#39;re looking for ease-of-use. While this canopy tent is not suitable for every purpose or climate, if you plan to use it in an area where the winds are mild, it may be just right.</p>\n<p>Because it takes only minutes to erect the tent, it is not only <a href=\"/blog/types-of-sun-shelters\">perfect for the beach</a>, but also for <a href=\"/blog/yard-sale-essentials\">yard sales, farmers&rsquo; markets</a>, and similar events where you want to finish setting up as quickly and conveniently as possible.

One idea to consider if you have a fireplace is burning wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this post, we will go over the basic steps to readying firewood to heat your home. But first, let’s briefly go over the benefits of turning to wood as a fuel source for residential heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the Benefits of Burning Wood for Heat?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cut costs. Central heat is expensive. But you can stay toasty and comfortable in front of your fireplace without running central heat if you are burning wood. That can significantly reduce your energy expenses.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Wood is an eco-friendly fuel source.

Many people enjoy the crackle of a fireplace and the flickering of the flames. The aroma of burning wood may also be pleasant.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Steps for Readying Firewood for Heating Your Home</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we have gone over some of the advantages of burning firewood for heat, let’s go over the basic steps to readying the firewood for use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT TIP:</strong> Make sure you have thoroughly reviewed safety precautions for every step in this list before you proceed. Wear appropriate protection for your eyes, ears, hands and feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>1. Cut down the tree.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Begin by felling an appropriate tree. A chainsaw is the right tool to use for this step. Be sure that you carefully gauge the tree’s height, weight, and the direction it will fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, you might want to turn to professional help with this step. It is important to stay safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Cut the tree into manageable 16-inch rounds.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have chopped down the tree, you can proceed to the next step, which is to reduce it to 16-inch logs.</p>\r\n\r\n <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\r\n        <img src=\"/img/axe-wood.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Axe and tree stump\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\r\n    </div>\r\n </div>\r\n <br />\r\n\r\n<p>A good way to approach this task is to set up a sawhorse in your yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, you will need to cut the tree into small enough sections that you can set them in the sawhorse. Use your chainsaw and get them down to around 40 inches each in length. You will have to do this sawing on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, place them one by one into the sawhorse, and saw them to around 16 inches each. This step will be easier since they are now raised up off the ground.</p> \r\n\r\n<h4>3. Use a log splitter.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have the rounds, you will need to split them. Traditionally, you can do this using an axe, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an alternative, consider getting a hydraulic log splitter. This type of device uses a powerful engine to apply the force necessary to split log after log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are not going to want to have to keep lugging a log splitter and sawhorse in and out of your garage. For that matter, even carrying a chainsaw back and forth can be a hassle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, you do not want to leave your equipment exposed to precipitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, one simple solution is to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-set-up-a-canopy-tent\">set up a backyard canopy tent</a>, and just keep your equipment stowed underneath it. You can even purchase a tent that includes sidewalls. That way, you can keep sideways rain away from your appliances.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>You can leave it set up for as long as you are going to need it for the season. Chances are good, however, that even after you move your log splitter, chainsaw, and sawhorse back to your garage, you will find another convenient use for your backyard canopy tent.</p> \r\n\r\n<h4>4. Choose a suitable location to stack the wood.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have finished splitting your firewood, you are going to need to stack it for storage. That means finding a location in your yard that is appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here are some recommendations for stacking the wood:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do not put the wood too close to your house. In fact, you want at least five feet of clearance. The reason this is important is because sometimes, pests get into firewood, and you do not want them getting into your home.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Think about putting down a pallet for your wood so that it is not in direct contact with the ground. This will assist with drainage if necessary.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Make sure that the wood is sheltered from precipitation, but that there is also open air flow for it to dry out (see below).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Think about the path that you will be taking when you walk with your firewood into the house.

Time to start being social again!','Charlotte Wolfgang','September 18, 2021','<p>With summer in full swing, this may be the perfect time to plan and host a backyard dinner party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, while summer is the classic season for a dinner party, you might also consider taking advantage of the temperate early days of autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the timing of your event, if you want your dinner party to be a glowing success, the key is all in the preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are some simple tips that can help you host a backyard dinner party that your guests will remember fondly for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Think carefully about your guest list.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a social event, ultimately, every dinner party is about its guests. So, planning a successful party starts with thinking carefully about whom you wish to invite and what each of them would appreciate in a dinner party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is wise to err on the side of inviting a smaller number of people rather than too many. It keeps the party more manageable, and also makes for a more intimate, exclusive experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, think not just about how you will interact with your guests, but how they will interact with each other. Make sure that you are inviting people who will get along.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Send invites out early.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want as many people as possible to RSVP in the affirmative, you should send out your dinner party invites as early as you can. Give everyone at least a few weeks’ notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check around with those you want to invite beforehand to figure out what days and times may be best for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Prepare what you can ahead of time.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take care of as many of the preparations for your dinner party as you can in advance before your guests arrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should be able to get everything set up and decorated before your guests are present. You might still have to take care of some food prep while they are there, but try and get as much cooking done beforehand as you can. That way, you can give your guests more of your attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Set up a canopy tent for shade and shelter.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody can have fun at an event where they are not comfortable. So, you should make plans for the weather, taking into account the different needs of your guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A perfect summer day for one guest could be uncomfortably hot and bright for another. By setting up a backyard canopy tent, you ensure that there is a comfortable spot to relax in the shade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"https://canopytentreviews.com/blog/best-canopy-tent-under-100\">affordable canopy tent</a> also is wise for contingency planning. After all, the sunny day forecast for your dinner party could end up interrupted by some unexpected mid-afternoon showers. But under a canopy tent, your guests can stay dry while continuing to enjoy the outdoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Choose a theme.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To create the right ambience for your dinner party, consider picking out a <a href=\"https://www.paperlesspost.com/blog/unique-dinner-party-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">unified theme</a> for your event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on what you are going for, this could be something specific, i.e. &quot;beach luau&quot;, or it could be something more general like a color scheme or decorative motif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme can guide you in coming up with decorations, and might also give you some ideas for activities.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>6. Ask your guests about special dietary needs.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When planning your menu for your dinner party, do not just think about what would taste good to you, but also about what your guests would prefer.</p>\r\n\r\n <div class=\"row\">\r\n 	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\r\n 		<img src=\"/img/food-for-party.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Food at a dinner party\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\r\n 	</div>\r\n </div>\r\n <br />\r\n\r\n<p>Do not forget that some members of your party may have specific dietary requirements. They may have food allergies, or might choose not to eat meat or dairy products. Make sure that there are edible options for everybody who will be in attendance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, try not to leave anyone out (i.e. do not prepare a spectacular wheat-based desert that the one wheat-intolerant person attending will not be able to enjoy).</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>7. Plan activities.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your guests probably will not spend the entire time at your dinner party eating. To make sure that there are no awkward lulls in the event, plan some potential activities for your guests to enjoy. Backyard games like bocce ball remain popular pastimes for those attending summer gatherings. Board games are a classic option as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not forget to account for the ages of your dinner party guests when you are thinking up prospective activities. If there will be children attending the party, ensure that there is something age-appropriate for them to enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Remember to put safety first.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, we are still living in the era of COVID. Indeed, at the time of this writing, we are seeing another spike in cases, this time for the delta variant. This variant is extra contagious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hosting an outdoor dinner party is certainly a safer option at this time than hosting an indoor dinner party. Nevertheless, it is important to continue to observe safety protocols, even outdoors.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you know the vaccination status of every person you are thinking of inviting as well as whether they may have recently been exposed to any potential carriers. Regardless of vaccination status, consider asking everyone to wear a mask to help to continue to prevent the spread of COVID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inform all of your guests about precautions you will be taking and asking them to take so that each of them can make decisions about their own health and safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enjoy Hosting a Successful Backyard Dinner Party</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are excited to host a backyard dinner party, it can be tempting to schedule right away and try to throw everything together last-minute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is worth putting in the extra time and effort to plan a truly successful event, even if that means a few weeks of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose your invite list with care, give your guests plenty of notice, and set up a canopy tent in your backyard with comfortable seating and beautiful décor. With enough attention to detail, you can &apos;wow&apos; your guests with every aspect of your event.</p> \r\n\r\n','/img/dinner-party.jpg','Misc'),('essentials-for-beach-trip',27,'8 Essentials for A Fun Beach Trip','Follow this packing list of essentials if you want to have a great family vacation at the beach.','Peyton Hillis','Nov 12, 2018','<p>Planning a trip to the beach soon? Let&rsquo;s talk about the essentials you&rsquo;ll need to pack if you want to spend the entire day in total comfort! We&rsquo;ll skip talking about some of the obvious things (i.e. a swimsuit, food, water, and some sunscreen). Instead, we&rsquo;ll focus on what you need to set up your site to have a great time.</p>\n<h3>Shade</h3>\n<p>The first thing you\'re going to need is shade. It is best not to rely on palm trees for this, however appealing that might sound. First of all, you do not know if the site you pick will have them. Secondly, even if they are available, other people may have set up underneath them already. Plus, they will only provide you with shade for part of the day. When the sun moves, there\'s nothing you can do about it.</p>\n<p>To ensure that you get all the shade you need for a long day at the beach, you will need to shop for some sort of beach canopy. Protecting yourself from excessive UVA and UVB rays while at the beach is critical to keeping your skin healthy. We think a <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">pop up beach canopy</a> is the best way to do this at the beach. The exact features that you need will depend on what you are looking for in terms shade, wind protection, ease of setup and portability, as well as the size of your party. In some circumstances, beach umbrellas or other types of tents might also be appropriate. Check out our recent blog post on the <a href=\"/blog/types-of-sun-shelters\">different types of shade tents</a> that you can use while at the shore to determine which might be best for you.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/tent-outside-cave.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Tent on beach outsive cave\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Towels</h3>\n<p>Whether you plan to go swimming or not, you will definitely want to pack some towels. Even if you do not take a dip, you might still get splashed while you are walking along the shore. Towels are also comfortable to lay down on. Choose some which are large and fluffy.</p>\n<h3>A Cooler</h3>\n<p>If you will be at the beach for more than a few hours, food and water are pretty much a given for your packing list. But you should also think about bringing a small cooler with you. You may think of this as a luxury rather than something that you really need, but you might feel differently about it after a long, hot day in the sun. A high-quality cooler can keep your food and beverages chilled for days.</p>\n<h3>Chairs or Hammocks</h3>\n<p>Next up, you will need to think about seating. While a towel on the sand may be sufficient for some beachgoers, others may prefer something off the sand. Consider packing some chairs. You can purchase collapsible seats which are designed to be lightweight and portable for transport in your vehicle.</p>\n<p>If you want to save space while you are packing and you do not mind reclining, consider <a href=\"/blog/legit-double-hammock\">hammocks as an alternative</a>. You can easily roll up a hammock and stuff it in the backseat of your car, and then carry it with you to your site on the beach. Of course, you will need somewhere to hang it, so this only really works if there are trees where you are headed.</p>\n<h3>Sleeping Bags</h3>\n<p>Planning on camping on the shore? Unless you know for sure that the weather is going to be hot all night, you probably should bring sleeping bags with you. After a hot day, you might expect perfect sleeping weather, but it can get to be surprisingly cold down by the water, especially if the wind kicks up. For this reason, you should layer your clothes as well.</p>\n<h3>Bug Spray</h3>\n<p>If you were going to be hiking in the woods, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t even think before packing insect repellent. But for some reason, a lot of us forget that the beach can also be a hot spot for bugs.</p>\n<p>Mosquitoes and sand fleas can be particularly problematic. So make sure that you are bringing repellent which is specifically formulated to deal with these pests (and any others which are prevalent at the beach in question).</p>\n<h3>Bug Screen for Hammocks</h3>\n<p>For camping, you may want to consider bringing an additional supply to help you deal with the insect population at the beach: a bug screen. This is not necessary if you are going to be sleeping in a tent, since your tent should be able to keep out the resident bugs on its own.</p>\n<p>But if you will be sleeping in a hammock, mosquitoes, flies, and other insects can easily drive you crazy all night if you are relying solely on bug spray to keep them at bay. With a bug screen for your hammock, you can sleep restfully through the night and not wake up covered from head to toe in bites.</p>\n<h3>Materials to Help You Keep Sand Under Control</h3>\n<p>Sand getting all over every surface may seem like part of the appeal of going to the beach &hellip; but I&rsquo;m guessing you will get tired of it fast, especially if you are planning on spending the night on the shore.</p>\n<p>There are a number of supplies you can use to help control the sand at your site. To start with, if you are going to have a tent with a floor with you, you should think about bringing a mat along as well. You can wipe your shoes or feet off on the mat before entering the tent.</p>\n<p>Some sand is probably still going to get tracked in however, so you might want to bring something with you to help you sweep it out. A small brush can work perfectly well for this.</p>\n<p>One last supply in this category which you might not think of is baby powder. Its absorbent properties help to remove water from the sand grains, drying it out. This will help you remove it from surfaces it has caked onto. This can be a huge help when you are camping.</p>\n<h4>Now You Have What You Need for an Awesome Day at the Beach</h4>\n<p>You now are ready to set up the perfect site for a day at the beach. If you\'re thinking about camping overnight, you also have a start on your supply list. Take the time to pick out the very best supplies, read our posts on <a href=\"/blog/best-beach-canopy\">what to look for in a beach canopy</a>, and you can look forward to enjoying a perfect day at the beach.</p>','/img/hammock-on-beach.jpg','Beach'),('fall-activities-for-kids',69,'Fun Fall Outdoor Activities for Kids','Fan can be such a special time of year to share with your children. Here are some ideas of what you can do!','Dan Demario','October 24, 2021','<p>Fall is here! This is the perfect time to get outdoors with your family and enjoy the crisp weather and the delights of the season.</p>\n\n<p>Looking for some fall activities for your children this year? Here are some fun autumn play ideas your kids will love.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Picking pumpkins</h3>\n\n <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/pumpkin-picking.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Young girl picking pumpkins\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<p>Head to your local pumpkin patch so your children can pick out their favorite pumpkin! Then let your kids choose or design a pattern for you to carve. While you work on carving the pumpkin, have your kids extract the seeds and set them aside. That way you can bake them later in the oven with a little salt for a tasty fall snack.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Making leaf piles</h3>\n\n<p>Have lots of trees shedding fall leaves all over your backyard? Grab some rakes, and get those leaves into a nice, big pile for your kids to jump in! You can also try piling them up at the base of a slide if you have one in your yard.</p>\n\n<p>The bonus with this activity is that you have found a sneaky way to get your kids to help with the raking. Once the leaves are in a pile, it will be easy to get them bagged up after your children are done with their play.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Decorating for Halloween</h3>\n\n<p>Decorating in the fall can be a lot of fun. Take your kids to the store to pick out some spooky Halloween decorations for your yard. Then, enjoy setting them up together. Go all-out for extra fun!</p>\n\n<h3>4. Campfires with marshmallows</h3>\n\n<p>Have a fire pit in your backyard? There is no better time of year to sit out back as a family and roast some marshmallows. It will be chilly enough to make the most of the warmth of the fire, but not so bitterly cold yet that sitting outdoors in the evening will be uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>If it is close to Halloween, this is also a great chance to share some ghost stories!\n\n<h3>5. Picnics</h3>\n\n<p>Just as fall is a great time to roast marshmallows, it is also an ideal season <a href=\"/blog/beach-picnic\">for a picnic</a>! Head to a park and set up a canopy tent. Sit under the shade and enjoy a delicious meal while you take in the spectacle of the fall leaves.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Fall crafts</h3>\n\n<p>There are dozens of autumn craft ideas that kids can make. For example, they can craft little &apos;people&apos; using twigs, leaves, and acorns. Or they can use pinecones to create birdfeeders. You can often <a href=\"/blog/things-to-do-to-make-your-craft-fair-booth-stand-out\">find craft booths</a> at fall festivals, too.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Do some fall gardening.</h3>\n\n<p>While a lot of gardening tasks take place during spring, quite a few also take place in fall. So, this is a great time of year to get kids involved in garden maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>Teach kids about flower bulbs that are best to plant in fall, and have them pick out some they like. You can work together to choose suitable spots for them.</p>\n\n<p>There might also be some plants that need to be cut back around this time of year. If some of your kids are old enough to safely use garden shears, they can help you out with this chore as well.</p>\n\n<p>If your kids learn to love gardening in the fall, they may be excited to help you again when spring rolls around. And they will have a fun time watching the flowers they planted blossom the next season.</p>\n\n<h3>8. Have a scavenger hunt.</h3>\n\n<p>Another activity you can do with your children outdoors in fall is a scavenger hunt. You can create the hunt yourself by coming up with a list of fall-themed items your kids can collect in your local area.</p>\n\n<p>With very young children, you can make the list really basic: &apos;Fall leaf,&apos; &apos;acorn,&apos; etc. But with older kids, you can get a little more elaborate: &apos;Oak leaf,&apos; &apos;maple leaf,&apos; etc. That way, the scavenger hunt can serve as an educational opportunity.</p> \n\n<h3>9. Pick apples.</h3>\n\n<p>Pumpkins are not the only fruits that you can collect during the fall season. You can also pick apples! If you are very lucky, you may have an apple tree in your own backyard. But if you do not, you look for an orchard or farm in your area that offers apple picking as an activity for guests.</p>\n\n<h3>10. Sensory play</h3>\n\n<p>For your toddlers, fill a bin with interesting objects you collected from your yard along with fall-themed items you purchased from a store. Try and add as many intriguing colors and textures as you can for your children to explore.</p>\n\n<h3>12. Leaf maze</h3>\n\n<p>If your kids tire of jumping in their leaf pile, you can turn it into a whole new activity just by spreading it out and using a rake to make pathways through it. Try and create a maze for your children to walk through, and challenge them to create some leaf mazes of their own.</p>\n\n<h3>13. Go camping and hiking.</h3>\n\n<p>One more fun outdoor activity not to miss out on with your children this year is hiking and <a href=\"/blog/autumn-camping-survival-guide\">camping</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We typically think of these as summer activities, but fall can actually be the ideal time for both. As long as you are prepared with the <a href=\"/blog/waterproof-tent-features\">right equipment</a>, the fall is a wonderful time to camp.</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, the heat of summer has passed, leaving more temperate days for exploring the great outdoors.</p>\n\n<p>For another, the crowds have also largely gone away as peak season has passed at many popular destinations.</p>\n\n<p>You can bring the same <a href=\"/blog/7-reasons-to-bring-a-canopy-tent-on-your-next-camping-trip\">canopy tent</a> with you on your camping outings as you use for picnics. While you will want to sleep inside a regular camping tent, the pop-up canopy tent can offer you additional shade and shelter from light rain during the day. You can store supplies under it or set up a table and chairs for dining.</p>\n\n<h2>Enjoy the Beauty of Autumn With Your Children</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you have toddlers, older kids, or teens, there are so many fun activities you can do together outdoors.</p>\n\n<p>So, enjoy this special bonding time to its fullest. Chances are good your kids will come up with some ideas of their own as well, so make fall family activity time a collaborative adventure.</p>','/img/fall-woods.jpg','Misc'),('fall-wedding',62,'Fun Fall Wedding Ideas','Fall weddings can provide opportunities for unique decor and stunning photos.','Ashley Avesono','November 29, 2020','<p>Autumn is here! You couldn’t ask for a better time to get married. The weather is more temperate than it is during summer or winter, the leaves are turning, and there is the promise of change on the crisp, cool air. What a time to begin a new journey with the person you love, and to celebrate your union in style with family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>Looking for ideas for a wedding that fits with the season? Here are some autumn wedding ideas you are going to love.</p>\n\n<h4>1. Choose an outdoor location with beautiful fall foliage.</h4>\n\n<p>Can you have a fall wedding indoors? Of course. But why would you? This is one of the most breathtaking times of the year. If you hold your wedding outdoors, you have the colourful foliage acting as a backdrop. It provides an instant colour palette for your celebration, and can make for stunning photos.</p>\n\n<h4>2. Incorporate autumn leaves into your décor.</h4>\n\n<p>Speaking of fall foliage, whether you hold your wedding ceremony and celebration indoors or outdoors, you can certainly incorporate the leaves into your <a href=\"https://www.brides.com/gallery/fall-wedding-decor-ideas\" target=\"_blank\">décor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fall branches and leaves can look beautiful in floral arrangements and centerpieces. You can use them to line the aisle for your ceremony. They even can work in lieu of confetti. You may come up with other ideas for how you can integrate them as well.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Serve autumn-themed cuisine and snacks.</h4>\n\n<p>One of the most exciting things about fall is all the delicious foods that come with it! This is the time of year to enjoy squash and pumpkin dishes, caramel apples, apple and pumpkin pie, and other tasty recipes, snacks, and treats. Autumn beverages like cider and pumpkin lattes can also refresh your guests.</p>\n\n<h4>4. Add rustic touches to your décor or even your wedding attire.</h4>\n\n<p>Rustic weddings have been all the rage for years now, and this trend isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>You can have a beautiful rustic wedding at any time of the year, but there is no denying that rustic décor seems particularly well-suited to autumn.</p>\n\n<p>So, consider using materials like burlap and wood. Make use of tree stumps, barrels, wagons, and other rustic elements.</p>\n\n<p>You can also go for a homespun look with your attire, opting for old-fashioned styles for the bride and groom.</p>\n <div class=\"row\">\n 	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n 		<img src=\"/img/rustic-fall-wedding-dress.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Bride in fall\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n 	</div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<h4>5. Set up a canopy tent for the celebration and <a href=\"/blog/wedding-canopy-tips\">decorate it</a> for fall.</h4>\n\n<p>If you are going to hold your wedding celebration outside, you are going to need a way to provide some shelter for your guests.</p>\n\n<p>You can set up the tables underneath large canopy tents. Canopy tents are ideal for fall weddings for a number of reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They are cost-effective.</li>\n<li>You can set them up quickly and easily. Taking them down should not take much longer than setting them up.</li>\n<li>You can choose to add or remove sidewalls as needed based on the weather the day of the celebration. If you wake up that day and the weather is fair, you can skip the sidewalls entirely. If it is a bit breezy and cold, or if there is rain, you can add as many sidewalls as you need.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/best-10x20-pop-up-canopy\">Canopy tents</a> offer shelter, but still allow guests to enjoy views of the surrounding fall landscape. In fact, you can even get sidewalls with windows. That way, even if you have to put them up, you do not block out the views entirely.</li>\n<li>Canopy tents allow for open airflow, allowing you to take advantage of beautiful fall weather and ensuring that your guests feel comfortable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How can you decorate your tent so that it fits with the fall theme? Think about putting bundles of corn, barrels, hay bales, or pumpkins around the legs of the tent (some of these may even help you provide more support for the tent on a breezy day). You can also tie bundles of branches, flowers, or other autumn décor higher up around the legs.</p>\n\n<h4>6. Offer blankets for guests.</h4>\n\n<p>A really popular outdoor wedding trend right now for autumn is to make blankets available for guests.</p>\n\n<p>Just get some baskets and neatly fold or roll up soft flannel blankets. Put them inside the baskets, and post signs next to them. The signs can say something like, \"To have and to hold in case you get cold.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not only do these blankets fit within the fall theme while keeping your guests comfortable on a chilly day or night, but they also can serve as keepsakes for family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, you can use them when taking photos. No matter what your guests are wearing, when they have their blankets around them, they will be coordinated with each other and with your theme.</p>\n\n<h4>7. Accessorize for fall.</h4>\n\n<p>The bride will usually wear all white for the wedding, but there is no reason not to accessorize with a bit of color.</p>\n\n<p>Along with bringing rustic elements into your wedding attire, you can also add a touch of autumn.</p>\n\n<p>This can be as simple as the bride wearing flowers or leaves in her hair in the orange, gold, and red tones of the season. The groom can wear a matching boutonnière.</p>\n\n<p>This is a great way to coordinate your wardrobe with each other and with your décor to make for even more photogenic shots of your special day.</p>\n\n<h4>8. Invite guests to sit around the fire.</h4>\n\n <div class=\"row\">\n 	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n 		<img src=\"/img/wedding-fire-pits.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Fire pits at a wedding\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n 	</div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<p>If your celebration will go on into the evening, you can warm up your guests not just with blankets, but also with fire pits. Have marshmallows available for toasting, and offer ingredients that guests can use to make s’mores.</p>\n\n<h2>Enjoy Planning Your Fall Wedding</h2>\n\n<p>Now you have some ideas for how you can plan your wedding ceremony and celebration this autumn. Make the most of the temperate weather, the colorful leaves, and the colors and flavors of the season. This is a day you will remember forever, and with a beautifully planned wedding, you will find yourself reliving those memories every fall as the leaves start to turn.</p>','/img/fall-wedding.jpg','Wedding'),('family-summer-holiday',15,'Family holiday checklist','We go over the products essential for family travel.','Kenneth Huebsch','October 22, 2017','<h4>An essential checklist for your next family holiday</h4>\n<p>Planning a holiday? Well, we’ve put together a checklist to help you on your way. Yes, you’ll have to adapt it depending on your destination, the time of year and the age of the children in your party, but here are the few things to consider:</p>\n<h4>Paperwork and passports</h4>\n<p>First and foremost, ensure you have all necessary paperwork with you, including travel documentation, insurance, ID, health insurance information, and booking confirmations. Don’t assume you’ll be able to access the information remotely, keep a hard copy to hand, so you can access crucial information whenever you need to.</p>\n<h4>Currency is crucial</h4>\n<p>If you’re travelling abroad, then ensure you have a sufficient amount of the relevant currency for at least the first day or two of your holiday; and research beforehand where you can procure some more. Always carry a credit card for emergencies and let your bank know you are travelling abroad.</p>\n<h4>Devices and chargers</h4>\n<p>Ensure you’ve packed all the mobile devices you’ll want on your holiday, the chargers to go with them and plug adapters if necessary. Check what your accommodation and rental car include, so you’re not duplicating equipment and taking more than is necessary.</p>\n<h4>Day-to-day essentials</h4>\n<p>Pack all those supplies that help your day go smoothly, from toiletries to contact lenses, spare glasses, a basic first aid kit, insect repellent and any regular prescriptions you take. Plastic carriers bags and sandwich bags are also of help in lots of ways, so pack a few.</p>\n<h4>Clothing considerations</h4>\n<p>The clothing you pack is very much down to the type of family holiday you’ve booked, but keep an eye on the local weather reports, so you can alter your capsule wardrobe as required.</p>\n<h4>Children’s must-haves</h4>\n<p>For the children in your party make sure you have some favourite toys, books and rainy day activities, plus any age appropriate kit required such as baby monitors, nappies, bibs and bottles.</p>\n<h4>Journey matters</h4>\n<p>Whether you’re taking your car, are taking a flight or are using public transport; pack a few essentials to improve your travel experience. If you’re faced with a long car journey, then pack a few CDs, audio books, suitable games, water, travel sweets and refreshments, so you are as comfortable as possible.

Hopefully, you will achieve success. But to do so, you need to make sure that you set up your booth right. Following are some tips to get you started.</p>\n <h3>Know what you can and cannot sell</h3>\n <p>Every farmers market has different policies concerning allowed products. Some farmers markets take the phrase \"farmers\" quite literally, only permitting produce and other goods from your farm or garden.</p>\n <p>At other farmers markets, you may be free to offer a wide range of products for sale such as handcrafted goods. Only once you know what merchandise you can bring can you figure out the details for setting up your booth.</p>\n <h3>Set up a canopy tent</h3>\n <p>While it is possible to operate a booth at a farmers market without any sort of shade, it is typically not a great idea. A <a href=\"/\">canopy tent is a must</a> for the following reasons:</p>\n <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n          <img src=\"/img/farmers_market_canopy_tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Setting up canopy tent for farmers market\">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n <ul>\n <li>Some of your merchandise may spoil or wilt easily if exposed directly to the bright, hot sun. A canopy tent can protect these items so that you can display them for longer.</li>\n <li>You also may start feeling like you are wilting if you set out in the sun for hours on end with no shade. A canopy tent can help you feel more comfortable and remain alert and energetic.</li>\n <li>A canopy tent also can give customers a break from the direct light of the sun as they browse your merchandise. This may tempt them to spend more time in your booth and walk away with more products purchased.</li>\n </ul>\n <h3>Be mindful of what you put out in the sun</h3>\n <p>To figure out the optimum layout for items within your tent, the sun is still a factor you will need to consider. What time of day will you be at the farmers market? What path will the sun follow? Do you have flowers or produce that needs the shade and other products which can sit in the sun without consequence? Arrange your stock accordingly.</p>\n <h3>Purchase the tables, crates, and displays you need</h3>\n <p>Your farmers market booth will need some sort of displays for your merchandise. Assuming that you are largely stocking produce, you can probably just get away with a few tables covered with tablecloths and some crates or boxes on top of those. You should also check out our blog post on <a href=\"/blog/yard-sale-essentials\">essential items for a yard sale</a> to get additional ideas of things you might need.</p>\n <p>If you are stocking other types of items such as handcrafts, you may meet some additional specialized product displays. For example, if you make scarves or jewelry, display models which are made to showcase those items could go a long way toward enhancing their appeal.</p>\n <h3>Bring some backstock</h3>\n <p>Assuming all goes well, over the course of the day, you should be clearing out some or all of the merchandise which you put out when the farmers market opens.</p>\n <p>Leaving a little bit of empty space on top of your tables is not necessarily a bad idea. It shows that people are purchasing your products.</p>\n <p>But you do not want to leave too much space. If you do, your booth will become less appealing from a visual standpoint. It will stand out less, and people will be less drawn to it. It may even come across as paltry&mdash;like you simply showed up without a lot of merchandise because you are not that productive.</p>\n <p>To solve the problem, bring more merchandise than fits on your tables all at once. Keep this backstock underneath your tables. If you cover the tables with long tablecloths, they will be concealed from view and will not clutter up the appearance of your booth.</p>\n <p>The look you are going for should be one of abundance, but it should not be overwhelming or distracting. Customers&rsquo; eyes should be drawn to your products, not to your clutter.</p>\n <h3>Make use of color</h3>\n <p>When it comes to making your farmers market booth stands out, an <a href=\"https://expresstext.net/blog/psychology-of-colors-in-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">eye for color is essential</a>. By nature, many of the goods which are sold at farmers markets tend to be bright and eye-catching (i.e. produce).</p>\n <p>If you have colorful items to sell, try to arrange them in a way which emphasizes their hues. If you do not, you will need to find other ways to make your booth colorful. The tablecloths you choose can help with this. You can also pick a canopy tent in a bold color. A good recommendation is not to use too may different hues&mdash;just a few colors which complement each other well and create a unified look.</p>\n <h3>Invest in clear and eye-catching signage</h3>\n <p>Another way you can bring more <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/intentsbusiness/farmers-market-signage/\" target=\"_blank\">color to your booth is through your signage</a>. Here are some other tips for effective signage:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>Choose a large, legible typeface, and think about what it will look like both close-up and from a distance across the farmers market.</li>\n <li>Whatever colors you go with, make sure that the contrast is sufficient that the signage remains easy to read.</li>\n <li>Along with signage that identifies your booth and your products, make signs to draw attention to sales and specials.</li>\n <li>Put your signage where people can actually read it. The best location is right on your canopy tent at the top above the entrance. That way, people can spot your booth more easily across a crowd. You can either purchase a regular canopy tent and attach a sign to it, or you can commission a customized canopy tent which is emblazoned with the name of your business and your logo.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Success at Your First Farmers Market Begins With a Beautiful Booth</strong></p>\n <p>A farmers market can be an incredible opportunity to grow your customer base, put your name out in the community, and increase sales. For some businesses, <a href=\"/blog/trade-show-canopy-tent\">trade show</a> and farmers market appearances can become a main source of revenue. By following the tips above when you are setting up your first farmers market booth, you can maximize your chances of achieving the success of your dreams.</p>','/img/vegetable-stand.jpg','Misc'),('finding-the-right-beach-tent',11,'Protect your skin with less work','There\'s a good reason why beach tents are becoming the most popular form of shade on the beach.','Eric Schroeder','September 25, 2017','<p>Maybe it’s the thought of not having to answer emails or phone calls for a week, or maybe the sound of crashing waves as I read a new book with my feet in the sand. There are very few things I look forward to more than vacation. And for many of us that vacation is a week-long trip to our favorite beach with our family and friends. A getaway from reality, a place where not much else matters, an escape from our concrete jungles; the beach is a special place. A philosopher once said of the beach ‘I got my toes in the water, butt in the sand, not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand, life is good today’. Oh wait. Never-the-less Zac Brown couldn’t have said it better. While he is correct in saying hydration is a key ingredient to a good time, the most important part of any beach trip is keeping our skin protected from the sun to ensure that it’s not a bad time. I did say not much matters at the beach, but I must expand on that and say there are a few things that we must think about. As research has improved over the past two decades, we’ve learned a lot about the effects that prolonged sun exposure can have on our skin. Let me give you a hint, it’s not good. Beach goers are particularly vulnerable to sunburn because they often forget to follow a few important precautions. Wearing a bathing suit exposes much more of our skin and bodies to the sun and beach goers often forget to wear or reapply sunscreens as often as they should. These are in addition to having to worry about sunscreen wearing off as we swim in the ocean, dry off with a towell, or sweat in the hot sun. All of these reasons are compounded by the fact that we’re typically at the beach for longer periods of time than we are in our backyards. According to <a href=\"http://skincancer.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">skincancer.org</a>, 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in the course of their lifetime and each year there are over 5.4 million cases of nonmelonoma skin cancer treated. These are scary statistics. But there are things that we can do to significantly mitigate these risks. In addition to sunscreen, we have found one of the best ways to offset these risks is to invest in some shade for the beach. We have a team scouring the internet and local sporting goods stores on a daily basis to find the best beach tents on the market because you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your time before an upcoming vacation. From compression hub systems, side pull hub systems, top pull hub systems, to bottom pull hub systems, who knew there were so many options of beach tents to choose from. It can be overwhelming trying to identify which one will be the best for you or your family. No need to worry - we know you’re busy with packing and prepping, so we’ve vetted the specs on all the sun shelters we could get our hands on to bring you a ‘best of’ list to help you keep your skin safe on vacation.</p>\n\n<p>When many of us think beach shade we think of the 10’ x 10’ pop up canopy tent. Since the early 2000’s when the canopy tent started to be manufactured with a single piece frame and easy to use telescoping legs, we saw an immediate rise in beach goers setting up camp with these popular canopies. And for good reason. They are phenomenal products with well-engineered structures that are super easy to use and provide ample shade for family and friends. But starting around 2010, the 10’ x 10’ canopy tent’s little sibling “the sun shelter” has exploded in popularity. Beach tent, sun shelter; these names refer to the half dome style tent we are going to be referring to in this article. Perhaps a result of millennials making up the largest population of beachgoers, the trend is right in line with the overwhelmingly common ideologies of young people; convenience and affordability. The price tag on most of these tents is half the price of a typical 10’ x 10’ pop up canopy tent, and the convenience factor of these shelters is unmatched. And when it comes to beach travel we’re all about convenience.</p>\n\n<p>When I walk from the car down to the beach, I have a bag on my back, my two year old son on my shoulders and a beach trolley (with the cool sand wheels) loaded to the top with toys, shovels, games, towels, chairs, and a thousand other things I probably won’t use. The bottom line is that I don’t have any extra hands or space to carry much else, and I’m certainly not making two trips. The average weight of the beach tents we reviewed is 7 lbs and the ability for these tents to fold into a bag that is no longer than 3 ft. and no wider than 3 inches is a remarkable feat. Every shelter on our Top 5 list comes with a carrying bag that is easily slung over a shoulder, and at just 7 lbs. it weighs less than the bag I’m already carrying and feels like a feather compared to the 40 lbs. child on top of my shoulders.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I do when I arrive at a good beach spot is set up my tent. One of my favorite things about these beach tents is how easy they are to set up. This is a result of the hub system. As I mentioned we’ve seen compression hub systems, side pull hub systems and top pull hub systems and bottom pull hub systems. The hub comprises of an ingenious frame design made of fiberglass rods that serve as the shell of the tent. I remember when I was a kid and we would go camping, the frame of the camping tent came with individual rods that needed to be inserted into one another to form the frame. Then threading the rods through a loop in the canopy material was next to impossible without the connection joints coming apart. I remember it often taking more than 20 minutes to set it up, and being frustrated and annoyed that is was so difficult once it was finally up. The hub system has completely reinvented this design. It allows the shelter to be stored in the carrying bag completely assembled with the fiberglass rods already integrated throughout the canopy, and with a quick pull of the hub system drawstring it allows for almost instant setup or teardown. Let’s break down the difference in the hub systems.</p>\n\n<p>A bottom pull hub system is a very similar to how an umbrella is set up. Once the beach tent is removed from the bag, stand underneath the canopy and place one hand on the bottom of the hub system (similar to the top of an umbrella) and pull down on the pull string. A side pull hub system is a similar motion to what shooting a bow-and-arrow would feel like. Once the tent is removed from the bag, stand behind the canopy and place one hand on the hub, and with the other hand draw the pull string back toward your chest. A top pull hub system is typically found on smaller sun shelters because it would be difficult to reach on larger ones where the hub is higher. A top pull has two drawstrings on opposite sides of the hub and requires both hands pulling on the strings in opposite directions. Once the pulling motion is completed on all of these systems, the fiberglass rods flex into position and lock into place. It typically takes less than 30 seconds from the time of opening the bag until setup is complete. Conversely, teardown is just as simple for every hub design. Simply remove the connection with a pull of fiberglass rods nears the top, and the hub releases the tension on the rods and the beach tent collapses on itself with ease. I found that the side pull is most common on the <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com/best-beach-tents\">best beach tents</a> I would consider it my preferred hub system. The bottom pull might be more difficult due to having to climb underneath the canopy, which I understand might be challenging for some. I’m 6’2” so I prefer the larger and slightly taller beach tents, and the top pull hub system isn’t as common on a lot of the tents that I reviewed. Let me explain why I prefer the larger tents, other than because I’m tall.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I look for in a beach tent is the size and capacity of the shelter. Most of these beach tents are designed to hold 2 or 3 people; however there are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0159JSKYE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0159JSKYE&linkId=f61c62ab54ec5b9020cc239f04d49122\" rel=\"nofollow\">3 and 4 person tents</a> available as well. I personally recommend the larger 3 and 4 person tents, even if there are only 1 or 2 people, because the increased dimensions do not greatly affect portability (weight and bag dimensions), and provide much more square footage and shade underneath the canopy when fully setup. Larger beach tents often come with a longer overhang on the front and will provide much more shade as the sun is directly overhead and reaches its highest peak in the sky. The larger 3-4 person shelters typically have dimensions around 5’ in height, 8’ in length, and 5’ in width when fully setup. The smaller 2-3 person shelters typically have dimensions around 4’ in height, 7’ in length, and 4’ in width. With all the stuff I have taking up valuable real estate in the shade – coolers, bags, chairs, towels; it doesn’t feel quite as overwhelming and crowded with the larger setup.</p>\n\n<p>The next thing that I look for is the flooring of the tent. I was concerned when I was looking to purchase my first beach tent because I enjoy my chair and feet in the sand when I’m at the beach. I love that Pacific Breeze tents come equipped with an unzippable floor, giving you the option to put your chair or feet in the sand, or keep it zipped if you wish to keep your belongings less sandy. Not all brands have this capability, but I highly recommend you keep an eye out for this feature if it is something that is important to you as well. Windows and air circulation are also near the top of my list of things to check for. I personally want to have three windows in a beach tent, one on each side and one on the back to allow a breeze to come through the canopy from any direction. Two windows would still serve this purpose quite well and provide air circulation, but in general finding a beach tent with at least some removable or zipperable window covering is a must. Even though these tents are half dome and open facing, a hot sun at the beach with little-to-no breeze and insufficient air circulation can be quite uncomfortable, even in the shade. Lastly, with everything I talked about in our opening and needing to protect our skin, I want to make sure that the beach tent material provides sufficient UPF to keep us safe from the suns potentially harmful rays. UPF is the Ultraviolet Protection Factor, and some materials out there are better than others at reflecting these harmful rays. Every sun shelter on our list is engineered with 50+ UPF, which is as good as it gets. Without this rating, even a material you might think is blocking the sun could still penetrate and cause damage to our skin. If you happen to choose a tent not our on list, double check to ensure the UPF is 50+ to protect yourself. An added bonus is that most of these UPF material canopies are constructed with a polyester fabric which is resistant to water in case of some unexpected showers pop up.</p>\n\n<p>Overall with everything we’ve talked about I hope you can understand why purchasing a lightweight beach tent is a great investment. I love being at the beach on a hot summer day, it’s one of my favorite things. But I’ve come to realize that I need to be safe and protect my skin, and teach my kids to be responsible about sun protection. Sunscreen will always remain one of the most important things for skin protection but having a place where we can get out of the sun, even for just a little bit, will make beach time and vacation that much more enjoyable. The convenience alone makes them worth it, and at a fraction of the cost of a traditional canopy tent it becomes a no brainer.

The shelter had a polyester canopy. It was a mild day and we grilled with lid off and fried the turkey with the turkey fryer lid closed. We cooked for about an hour. During that time there were no injuries and no serious equipment damage, but these are the risks we identified.</p>\r\r<h2>Damage to Self</h2>\r\r<p>Polyester, vinyl, and polyethylene are all made with plastic fibers. Whenever these fabrics come into contact with a strong heat source, they melt. All three materials can burn, but this isn’t as common as melting. Whenever the plastic fibers melt, they turn into liquid plastic. The most serious risk to grilling under a canopy tent is that melting or burning synthetic canopy fabric could fall onto a person under the tent. This can happen in two primary ways. First, the melting liquid plastic could condense into a droplet of liquid plastic and fall onto somebody. This could cause serious harm if it lands on a living thing or could start a fire if it lands on a flammable surface. The second risk is that the canopy would become damaged enough from the heat that the entire canopy would fall down. If this landed on a person it could physical damage because the canopy would be laced with melted liquid plastic. The canopy could also ignite if it fell and landed onto the open flame of a grill. Both of these risks are very serious and should be a strong deterrent to ever operating an open flame under a canopy tent.</p>\r\r<h2>Damage to Equipment</h2>\r\rAs we talked about above, the flame can cause the most damage and can very easily melt the synthetic fabric of the canopy. But, there are also two other factors that we didn’t originally consider that can also damage your canopy tent. \r\r<h3>Damage from Smoke</h3>\r\r<p>While we were frying our turkey, wonderful smelling peanut oil steam was rising from our fryer making us all incredibly hungry. Smoke from the burgers was also rising, mixing with the turkey steam to create a delectable aroma. The problem was that all of this smoke was rising and getting stuck at the apex of the canopy. It wasn’t smoky under the tent, but we noticed a slight haze where the smoke was trapped. After we cooked we found that the fabric of the canopy had stained. There was a slight yellow hue close to the top. The fabric smelled like peanut oil as well and when we went to tear down the shelter a few hours later, we found that bugs were attracted to the smell. Since our experiment, which was a few weeks ago, I have opened the roller bag that we packed the canopy tent into, and it still smells like a delicious peanut oil fried turkey.</p>\r\r<h3>Damage from the Flame</h3>\r\r<p>I had to use lighter fluid to light the charcoal and when I did this there was momentarily a large flame. While the flame was large a small ember rose into the air and made contact with the canopy. This immediately caused a small hole to form. You can see the hole in the picture below.</p>\r\r<div class=\"row\">\r    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\r            <img src=\"/img/canopy-fabric-burnt-hole.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Hole in canopy tent fabric from burning ember\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\r    </div>\r</div>\r\r<h3>Damage from the Grease</h3>\r\r<p>When we first put the turkey into the turkey fryer, a little peanut oil bubbled out and some got onto the leg of the frame of the canopy tent. I was able to get this off with soap and water, but during the process I must have gotten some oil on my hand and I touched the fabric. The oil soaked into the fabric and now that area has a slight shine to it, not matter how hard I try to clean it.</p>\r\r<p>Overall, we highly discourage operating any flame under a canopy tent. You can hurt yourself and damage your equipment. If you do decide to cook under a canopy tent, choose an area that is far enough away from any surroundings that if the whole shelter caught fire, the flame wouldn’t spread. Always have a fire extinguisher near by. If you are cooking and the canopy begins to melt or burn, get out from under the canopy immediately. Losing your canopy tent and a few burgers is much better than physical harm. If after all of this advice, you still decide you are going to risk it, make sure you understand that the smoke may discolor your canopy and give it an odor for the rest of it’s life. Also, don’t touch the canopy with your oily hands. Despite all of this advice, we know that a bunch of you are still going to throw your pop-up over your grill upon the first sign that you may get a little wet.

This one appliance can make camping a whole lot more fun and nutritious, making it easy to prepare meals that are every bit as delicious as those they might prepare at home.</p>\n\n<h3>4. A park pass</h3>\n\n<p>If your recipient hits national parks each year, one awesome gift idea is a National Park Annual Pass. This pass will let your recipient come and go from any national park all year long without paying any additional fees.</p>\n\n<p>This gift idea may also be ideal if your friend already has all the camp gear they could want, and/or you are not sure exactly what they might like. Of course, you need to make sure they do not already have an annual pass.</p>\n\n<h3>5. A backpacking tent</h3>\n\n<p>If your recipient does not yet own a high-quality backpacking tent, now is the time to get them one. A <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">waterproof tent</a> can keep them warm, cozy and dry no matter where they decide to pitch it or in what conditions. Look for a product that is fast and easy to set up or take down, and which features rugged materials and construction. A sturdy tent can offer years of comfort for outdoor adventures.</p>\n\n<h3>6. A compressible pillow</h3>\n\n<p>There is no reason these days for anyone to be sleeping uncomfortably in a backpacking tent. There are now camping supplies for just about every purpose, including providing some much-needed neck support in the wild.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there are now pillows you can purchase that can be collapsed to a fraction of their size just by squishing them into their storage bags. Buy your recipient one of these, and it will fit remarkably well in their backpack and keep them comfortable as they sleep in their waterproof camping tent.</p>\n\n<h3>7. A personal water filter</h3>\n\n<p>If you are in search of an inexpensive gift that also happens to be really useful and cool, you could get your recipient a personal water filter. This takes the form of a compact, portable straw that filters pathogens out of natural water sources. It is a great survival supply, perfect for any camping expedition, especially in the backwoods.</p>\n\n<h3>8. A waterproof notebook</h3>\n\n<p>If your friend or family member likes to keep a journal or field notes, one helpful gift for their next outdoor excursion might be a waterproof notebook. This is a particularly indispensable item for someone who likes to kayak or do other boating-related activities. But it can also come in handy for someone who hikes or camps in the rain.</p>\n\n<h3>9. A day pack</h3>\n\n<p>A backpack of any variety can make a good gift for an outdoorsy person. But it might be difficult to figure out exactly what your recipient would need in a backpacking pack.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that might be easier would be purchasing a day pack for your recipient. While day packs do come with different features and configurations, there are fewer bells and whistles to worry about. A simple, lightweight, stylish pack can be great for small day treks.</p>\n\n<h3>10. A high-quality water bottle or thermos</h3>\n\n<p>Another supply that is always useful is a well-made water bottle or thermos. Both have evolved considerably over the years, and you can now find some pretty impressive designs and features.</p>\n\n<p>Consider looking for a product that is eco-friendly and aesthetically appealing. If you are going for a thermos, check to see how long it can keep beverages hot or cold. It is even possible to find some containers that can maintain warm or cool temperatures inside for 12 hours or more. In fact, your recipient may not only find this product useful on the weekends, but also at work.</p>\n\n<h3>11. A quick dry towel</h3>\n\n<p>Hikers, campers, kayakers, swimmers, and others will be thrilled with the gift of a quick dry towel. You can find these made out of comfortable microfiber. Lightweight and small, they stow easily in a backpack.</p>\n\n<h3>12. Carabiners</h3>\n\n<p>If in doubt, sometimes it is best just to give an outdoorsy person something they always need more of. While your recipient likely already has a number of carabiners, chances are good they can benefit from more of them. Indeed, if it is the holiday season, they might be receiving other gifts that require them to get more carabiners, so why not take care of that for them?</p>\n\n<h2>Give the Gift of Outdoor Fun and Adventure</h2>\n\n<p>Now you have some outstanding gift ideas for the outdoor enthusiast in your life. Any one of these gift ideas should be a big hit, making your friend or family member&apos;s next outdoor excursion safer, more comfortable, and more enjoyable than ever.</p>','/img/hiking-gear.jpg','Misc'),('how-to-set-up-a-canopy-tent',46,'How to Set Up a Canopy Tent','Learn the basics of how to set up a 10 x 10 canopy tent so that you can hit the ground running at your next outdoor event.','Hunter Farva','July 8, 2019','<p>Whether you are planning a day at the beach or a weekend camping, a <a href=\"/\">pop up canopy tent</a> can offer you shelter from the rain and a reprieve from the bright sun. One of the reasons to choose this type of sun shelter is that it is fast and easy to set up with just one or two people. The following are the basic steps involved required to set up most tents.</p>\n<p>The first step involved with setting up a canopy tent is to locate a suitable site. It is worth putting some extra time and thought into this as choosing the right spot can make all the difference in the world when it comes to ease of setup as well as how functional and comfortable your tent will be throughout the day. Ideally, the ground should be as flat as possible, and there should be some shelter from the wind.</p>\n<p>Remove the pop-up canopy tent from its storage bag. There are two main components: the canopy and the frame (consisting of a <a href=\"/canopy-tent-buying-guide\">truss structure with legs</a>). You will see that the legs are folded up against each other so that they can fit inside the bag.</p>\n<p>Place the canopy over top of the legs. You may find it easiest to orient the canopy properly if you pull the legs a little bit apart first. This will allow you to see the shape of the tent.</p>\n<p>Pull the legs the rest of the way apart. This is like stretching out an accordion. The canopy will unfold as you do this as well, stretching across the top of the trusses. This step is easiest if you have two people. If you are working by yourself, you will need to move around the tent, pulling each leg out a little bit at a time until the tent is fully popped up and open.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/footprints-in-sand.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Footprints in sand\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>Double check the placement of the legs of the tent to make sure that they are stable and on an even surface. If you need to, you can move them around a bit to stabilize them further.</p>\n<p>At this point, even though the tent is open, it is not at its full height. There may be several height adjustments available for any given tent. You can raise or lower the tent at the legs. Once again, this will entail moving from leg to leg making the necessary adjustments as you see fit. You also might need to push up on the truss structure by hand to get the tent fully open. This too may entail moving from corner to corner.</p>\n<p>Once you have the height of the tent adjusted to your liking, you will need to secure the canopy to the frame. If you stand underneath your tent and look up at the sides, you should spot some straps which can be used to do this. These will prevent the canopy from blowing right off the trusses at the first strong breeze.</p>\n<p>Some pop-up canopy tents have vents which can be opened or closed. If it is raining, you may wish to close these vents in order to prevent water from dripping on you when you&apos;re underneath the tent. But on a very windy day, it is wise to open the vents. Doing so will prevent the canopy from billowing and being torn off.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the feet of the tent. If you see holes for stakes, you can further secure the tent to the ground by pushing the stakes through those holes. They were probably included with your purchase. If not, you will need to order them separately.</p>\n<p>Another accessory which can add more stability to your canopy tent setup is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilPcOy__vs\" target=\"_blank\">set of guy ropes</a>. Take a look at the corners of your tent canopy. Do you see little rings on each? This is where you can hook on the guy ropes. You can then adjust their length and attach them to stakes which you drive into the ground.</p>\n<p>If you decided to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=canopy+sidewalls%22&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d5a53cea6627441a55aa62f4618a00cf&tag=hersh09-20\" target=\"_blank\">purchase sidewalls</a> for one or more sides of the tent, you are now ready to attach those. Normally you can do this using Velcro at the top. You should see straps at the sides of the walls which you can use to fasten the walls securely to the poles of the tent.</p>\n<p>Congrats! You have now set up your pop-up canopy tent. If it is your first time doing this, it may take a little time to learn your way around the <a href=\"/blog/canopy-tent-accessories\">tent and its accessories</a>. But over time as you get some practice, you should discover that you can get the entire tent set up and ready to go in a matter of minutes, even working on your own.</p>\n<p>Once the tent is adjusted to your liking and secured using the guy ropes and stakes, you can go about setting up beach towels, chairs, and other items underneath. You will then be ready to enjoy the day in total comfort.</p>\n<p>How do you collapse the tent when you are done again? This is just a reverse of the process above. Un-stake the tent, remove the guy ropes and un-fasten the sidewalls. Then pull down on the truss structure and legs so that the height is at its lowest adjustment. Remove the canopy and fold it up, and then collapse the frame of the tent back together so you can stuff it inside the carrying bag along with the canopy.</p>\n<p>A Pop-Up Canopy Tent Is the Easy, Convenient Way to Spend a Day in the Shade</p>\n<p>While there are many types of sun shelters on the market, it is hard to beat a pop-up canopy tent when it comes to ease-of-use. With its compact, lightweight profile, you can take this type of tent with you anywhere you go, and with its fast and simple setup process, you can be under the shade in a matter of minutes. Bring one with you to your next beach trip, camping outing, or day at the farmers market or craft show. You&rsquo;ll be glad you did!</p>','/img/blue-water-sky.jpg','Misc'),('lakes-pt-1',84,'Our Favorite Lakes: West Coast','Part 1 of our 4 part series talking about our favorite lakes on the west coast.','Jamie Doranzzi','October 2, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n   <small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite lakes: <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-1\">Part 1: West Coast Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-2\">Part 2: Mountain Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-3\">Part 3: Midwest Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-4\">Part 4: Eastern US</a>.</small>\n </div>\n <br/>\n <p>If you enjoyed our recent series of posts introducing you to <a href=\"/blog/beaches-pt-1\">our favorite beaches</a> around the US, you will love the next adventure we are taking you on. In this series of posts, we will introduce you to our favorite lakes across the country. To kick things off, let’s explore some beautiful lakes in the West Coast region.</p>\n \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/chairs-on-lake.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Chairs next to lake\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <h2>Why Visit West Coast Lakes?</h2>\n \n <p>The West Coast is home to some dramatic scenery as well as a wide range of climate zones. Whether you are in Southern California, Washington State, or anywhere in between, you can find some stunning lakes surrounded by majestic vistas.</p>\n \n <h3>Big Bear Lake, California</h3>\n \n <p>If you are visiting Los Angeles or live there and you want to get away from the hustle and bustle, head east to <a href=\"https://www.bigbear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Bear Lake</a> in the San Bernardino National Forest.</p>\n \n <p>Big Bear Lake is home to the Bear Mountain Ski Resort and Boulder Bay Park. It is a hot spot not only for skiing and snowboarding, but also for water sports, hiking, and other outdoor fun. Nearby Big Bear City (which is a small town, not a city) has plenty of amenities, and you can rent a boat at one of the marinas or head out on a boat tour.</p>\n \n <p>You can camp in a tent or RV while visiting Big Bear Lake, or even with a horse!</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n  \n <p>At Big Bear Lake, you have everything you could want all in one place and reasons to visit in any season. But even with all the amenities, Big Bear Lake offers plenty of secluded spots that surround you with the beauty of nature. The large boulders also give the area a distinctive look that is unlike anywhere else.</p>\n \n <h3>Mountain Lake, Washington</h3>\n \n <p>You will discover the gem that is <a href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mountain-lake\" target=\"_blank\">Mountain Lake</a> in Moran State Park. This park is on Orcas Island in Washington State that is right near the border with Canada. You can reach the park by ferry. You can camp in an RV or tent; there are 151 sites in all. A few of them are even glamping sites.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The 5,424 acre park offers access to swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, and more. When you are taking a break from fun on the lake, you can discover beautiful waterfalls in the surrounding forest, or take in the views from the distinctive stone tower at the summit of Mount Constitution. The tower was constructed by the CCC during the 1930s, and is in the style of 12th century Russian watchtowers. So, there is some interesting history and architecture here.</p>\n \n <h3>Crater Lake, Oregon</h3>\n \n <p>While we are talking about the best lakes to visit in the West Coast region, there is no way we cannot mention <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Crater Lake</a>.</p> \n \n <p>No doubt, you are familiar with Crater Lake from photographs; it is the deepest lake in the US, and among the deepest worldwide. It takes its name from the fact that it is the caldera of Mount Mazama, a collapsed volcano.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4> \n  \n <p>While visiting Crater Lake, it may feel hard to believe that this was the site of such cataclysmic geological activity. Nowadays, it is a serene place to be; the waters are often still enough to produce stunning reflections of the surrounding terrain. Go driving, hiking or cycling, take a bus or trolley tour, or go fishing (no license necessary). You can stay at the famous lodge, or you can camp at Lost Creek Campground or Mazama Campground. There truly is no other experience quite like a stay at Crater Lake.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Visiting West Coast Lakes</h2>\n \n <ul>\n <li>Look up the amenities. Before you pack for your lake trip, check what amenities are available at the lake you are visiting and in the surrounding area. Will you be close to a marina or town? Or will you be out in the wilderness without access to services nearby? You may need to pack more or less, depending on what is available.</li>\n \n <li>Find out what activities are permitted. Are you allowed to fish in the lake? If so, do you need a license? Are you able to keep your catches, or do you have to throw them back? What about boating? What types of watercrafts are permitted on the lake, if any? Check what you are allowed to do on the shore as well.</li>\n \n <li>Make sure you know how to place a reservation if you will be camping overnight. If reservations are required, book early, especially if you are heading to a really popular destination. If the campsite is first-come, first-serve, have a backup plan in case you arrive only to find that the spots are full.</li>\n \n <li>Bring a <a href=\"/\">pop-up canopy tent</a>. While you might find a shady spot near a lake, quite often, lake shores are exposed to a lot of sun and wind. So, it can be to your benefit to bring your own shade in the form of a pop-up canopy tent. Within minutes, you can have some shelter, allowing you to enjoy the lake in extra comfort. If you will be visiting a Pacific Northwest lake, this is also a great way to keep the rain off of you.</li>\n \n <li>Dress for the weather. As we just mentioned, the Pacific Northwest can receive a lot of rainfall. Up in the mountains, it can also be cool and breezy, so bringing layers is a good move. If you are visiting a lake further south, you may need to concern yourself more with suntan lotion than layers. But do not forget that it can get to be cool up at elevation, even in Southern California!</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h2>Enjoy the Lakes of the West Coast</h2>\n  \n <p>Crater Lake, Mountain Lake, and Big Bear Lake are just a few examples of the numerous gorgeous lakes that dot the West Coast region of the US. Add these lakes to your bucket list, but be sure to research additional ideas. No matter where you will be traveling along the West Coast, you should find yourself close to an unforgettable lake!</p>','/img/west-coast-lake.jpg','Misc'),('lakes-pt-2',85,'Our Favorite Lakes: Mountain Region','Part 2 of our 4 part series talking about our favorite lakes in the mountain regions.','Jamie Doranzzi','November 25, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n   <small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite lakes: <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-1\">Part 1: West Coast Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-2\">Part 2: Mountain Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-3\">Part 3: Midwest Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-4\">Part 4: Eastern US</a>.</small>\n </div>\n <br/>\n <p>If you are in search of a new outdoor adventure, you cannot beat pitching a tent on the shores of a beautiful lake.</p>\n \n <p>In this series, we are sharing our favorite lakes with you across the country. Part 1 introduced you to a few stunning lakes in West Coast states. In this part, we will be giving you some lakes to add to your bucket list in the Mountain Region.</p>\n \n <h2>Why Visit Mountain Region Lakes?</h2>\n \n <p>The Mountain Region of the US boasts some of the most dramatic, awe-inspiring scenery you are going to find anywhere in the world.</p>\n \n <p>Not only that, but much of the land is wide open. It is not too hard to find spots that are relatively secluded, even when you are visiting popular lakes during peak tourist seasons.</p>\n \n <p>In fact, all three of our recommended lakes in the Mountain Region are well-known. But you will not find them overcrowded.</p>\n  \n <h3>1. Lake Powell, UT and AZ</h3>\n \n <p>On the border between Utah and Arizona, you will find a spectacular manmade reservoir called <a href=\"https://historytogo.utah.gov/lake-powell/\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Powell</a>. The only larger reservoir in the country is Lake Mead, so despite drawing millions of tourists yearly, it offers plenty of room for visitors to spread out and find secluded places to enjoy.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n  \n <p>Millions of years of erosion have shaped Glen Canyon into a wonderland of reddish rock and deep blue water. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area comprises 1.25 million acres, providing you with endless recreational opportunities. Boating, fishing, swimming, kayaking, hiking, road biking, and scenic drives are just some o the activities that are popular at Lake Powell. You can also participate in guided tours and ranger programs.</p>\n \n <p>If possible, we recommend visiting in May, or waiting until later in the season and heading up to Lake Powell in September or October. The crowds thin out around these times, and rates for campgrounds and boat rentals drop.</p>\n \n <h3>2. Grand Lake, CO</h3>\n \n <p>The largest natural lake in Colorado is <a href=\"https://www.grandlakecolorado.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Lake</a>, also the state’s deepest. Like Lake Powell, it is connected to the Colorado River. There is a small town located here as well that is also called Grand Lake, offering convenient amenities for visitors.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Grand Lake is a gorgeous location; the lake is surrounded by breathtaking mountain peaks, the tops of which become white with snow when the weather gets cool enough. The town has a charming old west look and feel. A public boat ramp and docks are available, along with a number of marinas.</p>\n \n <p>No matter what time of year you visit Grand Lake, you will find plenty to see and do. Go out on the water or hike when the weather is warm. If you visit in winter, the lake freezes over, and you can do ice fishing, ice skating, snowshoeing, skiing, and more.\n \n <h3>3. Yellowstone Lake, WY</h3>\n \n <p>No discussion of amazing lakes to visit in the Mountain Region would be complete without recommending <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/yellowstone-lake.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Yellowstone Lake</a>. This is the huge lake in the middle of Yellowstone National Park.</p>\n \n <p>You can boat and fish on Yellowstone Lake. You probably won’t want to swim in it, however; the water is very cold, even in summer. But there is a ton to see and do throughout the park. You can visit the famous geyser basins, take a hike in the canyon, or go look for animals in Hayden or Lamar Valleys, including bison, coyotes, elk, and more. If you are lucky, you might even spot some wolves or a moose.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n  \n <p>Yellowstone National Park is one of the most famous destinations on the planet for many good reasons. It is a geologically distinctive region with picturesque, unusual scenery. It is also a haven for wildlife. Even at its most crowded, you can find open vistas with few other cars or people around. And if you visit late in the season, you might feel like you have the whole place to yourself.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Visiting Mountain Region Lakes</h2>\n <ul>\n <li>Check how reservations work if you plan to camp. Find out in advance if you need to book a site or if you are just supposed to show up. Make your reservation early if you have that option. If it is first-come, first-served, then have some backup plans ready in case sites are full.</li>\n \n <li>Bring a <a href=\"/\">pop-up canopy tent</a>. Whether you are camping or just spending the day at a lake, you can set up a pop-up canopy tent in minutes to provide you with shelter from sun and wind. This is also a great spot to put your supplies. A pop-up canopy tent can make your entire outing more comfortable and enjoyable.</li>\n \n <li>Look into amenities and activities. Rules for swimming, fishing, boating and more vary from lake to lake, so find out what you can and cannot do before you start packing for your trip. Also check if restrooms, firewood, ice and other amenities are offered on-site or not.</li>\n \n <li>Pack layers. Weather in the Rockies can be notoriously fast-moving and unpredictable, especially if you are going to be driving around at all. In Yellowstone, for example, it is not uncommon to spend part of your day in a t-shirt and another in a coat. Rain and sun may trade places quickly as well. So, wear layers.</li>\n \n <li>Familiarize yourself with the local wildlife. In the mountains, you might run into bears, mountain lions, and other potentially dangerous creatures. Before you visit mountain lakes, find out what animals you might encounter and how you can stay safe. For example, it is important not to startle bears. Be aware that at some campgrounds, tent camping may not be permitted due to wildlife concerns.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h2>Enjoy the Lakes of the Mountain Region</h2>\n  \n <p>We hope you get a chance to spend some time at Lake Powell, Yellowstone Lake, Grand Lake, or any of the other beautiful lakes in the Mountain Region.</p>\n \n <p>We will explore more exciting destinations in Our Favorite Lakes, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-3\">Part 3: Midwest Region</a>.</p> ','/img/mountain-lake.jpg','Misc'),('lakes-pt-3',86,'Our Favorite Lakes: Midwest Region','Part 3 of our 4 part series talking about our favorite lakes in the midwest region.','Jamie Doranzzi','November 25, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n   <small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite lakes: <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-1\">Part 1: West Coast Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-2\">Part 2: Mountain Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-3\">Part 3: Midwest Lakes</a>, <a href=\"/blog/lakes-pt-4\">Part 4: Eastern US</a>.</small>\n </div>\n <br/>\n \n <p>In our most recent post in our series on lakes, we introduced you to some beautiful destinations to add to your bucket list in the Mountain Region. In today’s post, we will be exploring Midwest Region lakes.</p>\n \n <h2>Why Visit Midwest Region Lakes?</h2>\n \n <p>When many people think of the Midwest, they immediately picture endless fields stretching to the horizon. But the Midwest is also a land of lakes. The Great Lakes are located in this part of the country for starters. In addition, there are many smaller lakes that are not as well known that have a lot to offer.</p>\n \n <p>In fact, there is something for everyone. Whether you want to camp and fish at a small, secluded lake off-the-beaten-track or you are looking for a more popular lake where you can find a lot of amenities and activities for the whole family, Midwest lakes will delight you. Now, let’s check out three top recommended destinations.</p>\n \n <h3>1.  Higgins Lake, MI</h3>\n \n <p>If you’re from Michigan, you know what an amazing state it is for outdoor activities. If you’re not from Michigan, well, you’ve probably heard incredible things from anyone you happen to know who has ever lived there.</p>\n \n <p>For that reason, it is tough to choose just one lake to feature in Michigan, but we are going to go with <a href=\"https://www.michigan.org/city/higgins-lake\" target=\"_blank\">Higgins Lake</a> in Roscommon County.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The clear blue waters of Higgins Lake are spectacularly beautiful, making for a scenic experience.</p>\n \n <p>There is a ton to do while you are at Lake Higgins. You can fish for trout, smelt, perch and pike, swim, boat, golf, or explore South Higgins Lake State Park or North Higgins Lake State Park. There are also a lot of family-friendly activities in the area such as go karts, disc golf, and even the Roscommon Zoo. You may camp at either of the state parks.</p>\n \n <h3>2. Door County, WI</h3>\n \n <p>Want to experience Lake Michigan at its finest? We recommend visiting <a href=\"https://www.doorcounty.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Door County, Wisconsin</a>, a peninsula that extends out into the water near Green Bay.</p>\n \n <p>There are six state parks in Door County: Newport State Park, Peninsula State Park, Whitefish Dunes State Park, Potawatomi State Park, Grand Traverse Island State Park and Rock Island State Park. You also can visit a variety of fishery areas, state wildlife areas, and state natural areas. You’ll find yourself with 54 public beaches to choose from when you set up your canopy tent to enjoy a day next to the water.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Door County has been referred to as the “Cape Cod of the Midwest.” While you are there, it will be easy for you to understand why. Along with the state parks and other protected areas to explore, there are charming towns to discover plus ten different picturesque lighthouses to visit. You could return to Door County year after year without running out of things to do, and on every visit, you will feel you have truly escaped from the mundane.</p>\n \n <h3>3. Sylvan Lake, SD</h3>\n \n <p>One of the most beautiful Midwestern lakes can be found in Custer State Park in South Dakota. You can camp at <a href=\"https://www.blackhillsbadlands.com/places/sylvan-lake\" target=\"_blank\">Sylvan Lake</a>, but as RVs and fifth wheels are not permitted, it is ideal for those who like pitching a tent (and not being interrupted by large vehicles pulling in and out).</p> \n \n <p>While you will be surrounded by breathtaking natural scenery, you will also be close to a general store and other amenities.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>With its distinctive boulders, Sylvan Lake has an astonishing beauty all its own. You could be perfectly content just to lounge around on the shore, paddle in a boat, or cast your fishing line.</p>\n \n <p>But you will also be conveniently close to The Needles and Black Elk Peak, and you can use the lake as a staging ground for exploring the entire Black Hills area. There is truly no other place like it.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Visiting Midwest Region Lakes</h2>\n \n <p>Now that we’ve shared some of our favorite Midwest Region lakes with you, here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your trip.</p>\n \n <ul>\n <li>Find out if you need to make a reservation. Some campgrounds at Midwestern lakes may require bookings to be made in advance, especially if they are at popular destinations. The sooner you reserve your spot, the better.</li>\n \n <li>Have a backup plan. If you are not able to make a reservation in time or if you do not arrive sufficiently early at a first-come, first-served campground, make sure you have another plan for where you can spend the night. Thankfully, most campgrounds in the Midwest are not too far away from alternative accommodations and amenities.</li>\n \n <li>Pack a pop-up canopy tent. Whether you are spending the night at a lakeside or not, a pop-up canopy tent can shelter you and your equipment from the elements and make your day more enjoyable.</li>\n \n <li>Find out what you can rent on-site vs. what you need to bring yourself. For example, if you plan to canoe or kayak, are there rentals available where you are going? Or do you need to bring your own boat?</li>\n \n <li>The Midwest is notorious for unpredictable—and sometimes violent—weather. Always check the forecast to make sure you are packing what you need, dressing suitably for the conditions, and staying safe. Note: Rapid City leads the pack for unpredictable Midwest weather, so keep that in mind especially if you visit Sylvan Lake or other parts of the Black Hills.</li>\n \n <li>Be prepared for bugs. The Midwest as a region has a lot of insects, especially mosquitoes. So, make sure you pack your bug spray for your visit. And if you are going to be camping at a lake, you might even want to think about bringing mosquito netting with you.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h2>Have Fun Visiting These Midwest Region Lakes</h2>\n \n <p>We hope you enjoyed our selection of Midwest Region lakes, and have a chance to pay them a visit.

In Parts 1, 2 and 3, we introduced you to some of the best lakes to visit on the West Coast and in the Mountain and Midwest regions. In this post, we are going to recommend some top lakes in the eastern part of the country.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Visit Eastern US Lakes?</h2>\n\n<p>Much of the Eastern US is dominated by major metropolitan areas and the hustle and bustle of city life (especially the Northeast).</p> \n\n<p>Paying a visit to a lake in the eastern part of the US is an excellent way to get away from city life for a change and get back to enjoying the wonders of nature.</p>\n\n<p>Because most of the eastern US is not particularly remote, amenities at lakes in this part of the country tend to be pretty good, ensuring a comfortable visit at most destinations.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Walden Pond, MA</h3>\n\n<p>You will find one classic destination just northwest of Boston and south of Concord, Massachusetts: the famous <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/locations/walden-pond-state-reservation\" target=\"_blank\">Walden Pond</a>. No doubt you are familiar with this legendary lake (it is not a &quot;pond&quot; in a literal sense) if you are acquainted with <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/\" target=\"_blank\">the works of Henry David Thoreau</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You are not allowed to camp at Walden Pond, but we do not see any rules against setting up a <a href=\"/\">canopy tent</a> to enjoy an afternoon.</p> \n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>As you visit this peaceful destination, you will quickly see why Thoreau fell in love with it. It is a tranquil reprieve from everyday life, offering you the chance to hike, swim, or just lounge around enjoying nature. While you are here, you can learn more about Thoreau as well, and even drop by a cabin that was built as replica of the one where he stayed. There is a self-guided walking tour you can take to learn more. You can even retrace the steps taken by Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Louisa May Alcott by taking a stroll along the Emerson-Thoreau Amble footpath.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also be conveniently close to many other historical destinations in Concord, so you will find plenty to fill your time and connect you with famous American writers of the past.</p>\n\n<h3>2.  Finger Lakes, NY</h3>\n\n<p>Between Rochester and Syracuse, NY, and south of Lake Ontario, you will find the world-famous <a href=\"https://www.fingerlakes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Finger Lakes</a>. Each of these long, narrow lakes is beautiful to behold, and offers opportunities for outdoor recreation. There are a number of campgrounds scattered around the area, especially around the shores of the larger lakes.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>Along with experiencing the lakes themselves, you’ll find so much else to do in the surrounding area. You can visit wineries, go hiking in <a href=\"https://parks.ny.gov/parks/watkinsglen/maps.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Watkins Glen State Park</a>, or visit the fabulous <a href=\"https://home.cmog.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Corning Museum of Glass</a>. It is a distinctive region like no other, and your visit there will create lasting memories.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Tallulah Falls Lake, GA</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to head to a dramatic destination in Georgia, think about making a trip to <a href=\"http://www.tallulahfallsgeorgia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tallulah Falls</a>, which you will find in the northern part of the state.</p>\n\n<p>Tallulah Falls Lake is a small reservoir in Tallulah Gorge State Park, and just one of its attractions. Naturally, it is the falls themselves that are the main draw, especially Hurricane Falls.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>Hike the trails, cross the high suspension bridge, cycle, fish, paddle, swim, picnic, and more at Tallulah Falls. Whatever outdoor activities you are into, you will find endless opportunities to make the most of this gorgeous park.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that if you want to visit the floor of the gorge, you will need to drop by the Interpretive Center to pick up a free permit. You also will need to wear close-toed shoes.</p> \n\n<p>You will also find yourself conveniently close to quite a few other area destinations as well, such as <a href=\"https://gastateparks.org/BlackRockMountain\" target=\"_blank\">Black Rock Mountain State Park</a>, the <a href=\"https://helenga.org/alpine-village-shoppes/\" target=\"_blank\">Alpine Village of Helen</a>, <a href=\"https://gastateparks.org/MoccasinCreek\" target=\"_blank\">Moccasin Creek State Park</a>, the <a href=\"https://blueridgemountainstravelguide.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ridge Mountains</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/conf/\" target=\"_blank\">Chattahoochee National Forest</a>, and more.</p> \n\n<h2>Tips for Visiting Lakes in the Eastern US</h2>\n\n<p>To finish up this article, let’s go over a few recommendations for how you can get the most out of your time at lakes in the Eastern part of the US.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Book early. If you are planning on camping at or near one of these lakes, you are going to want to place a reservation as early as possible. Lakes are popular destinations for nearby city dwellers who want to get a break from urban life, so they tend to fill up fast. Needless to say, if a campground is first-come, first-serve, then you will want to arrive early for your best chance at a spot. Have a backup plan ready in case you are not fast enough.</li>\n\n<li>Bring a pop-up canopy tent. The Eastern US is subject to a wide range of weather conditions depending on what time of the year you visit. On bright days, you will be grateful for the shade provided by a pop-up canopy tent, and on rainy days, it will help you stay dry.</li>\n\n<li>Consider visiting in spring or fall. A lot of locations in the Eastern US are quite hot during summer, and sometimes very humid as well. But the Eastern US also can get to be very cold and uncomfortable during winter. That means the best times of year for outdoor activities are spring and autumn. If you can, try and book your camping reservations during these seasons. Fall is especially ideal, as then you might also be able to enjoy spectacular colorful foliage reflecting in the water.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Enjoy These Lakes in the Eastern US</h2>\n\n<p>That wraps up our series on the best lakes to add to your vacation bucket list. We hope you have a chance to visit a few of these destinations.

We investigate the specs.','Andrew Farkas','April 13, 2019','<p>Looking for a pop up canopy tent which is an all-around good choice in terms of durability, ease-of-use, setup and price? The <a href=\"https://www.leaderaccessories.com/index.php/goods/goodsview?gooditem=334#.XKTB7lVKiM8\" target=\"_blank\">Leader Accessories Instant 10x10 Canopy Tent</a> may be worth putting on your shopping list.</p>\n<p>In this <a href=\"/\">canopy tent review</a>, we will go over the specifications for this canopy tent as well as the features it boasts. We will then discuss briefly the pros and cons, and what buyers this tent may appeal to. Let&apos;s get started with the specifications now.</p>\n<h3>Specs:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Measures 10&rsquo;x10&rsquo;, offering 100 square feet of shade</li>\n<li>One-piece frame</li>\n<li>3 adjustable heights: 68.5\", 72.4\", and 76.4\"</li>\n<li>Frame is manufactured out of powder-coated steel</li>\n<li>Fabric offers UPF 50+ UV protection</li>\n<li>Includes 8 steel stakes and 4 tie-down lines</li>\n<li>Includes a bag with wheels</li>\n<li>Backed by a 1-year warranty</li>\n<li>Hub system for quick setup</li>\n<li>Air vents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having gone over the specs, let&apos;s take a deeper look at the features which make this pop up tent worth considering.</p>\n<h3>Materials and Durability</h3>\n<p>The frame is made of steel which has been <a href=\"https://www.powdercoating.org/page/WhatIsPC\" target=\"_blank\">powder-coated steel</a> which resists forming rust. The canopy meanwhile is made of silver back coated 210D polyester.</p>\n<p>While this pop up canopy tent is not the most durable one in the world, it is also not the flimsiest you&apos;ll find on the market either. It should not be subjected to strong gusts of wind, which can cause it to lose its shape or bust completely.</p>\n<p>Exposure to mild or moderate wind however should not be a major issue. You will need to use your judgment when determining whether the weather will be safe for your tent. If you notice that your tent seems to be losing stability, do not wait around to find out whether the gusts are too strong. Just take it down.</p>\n<h3>Protection from Sun and Rain</h3>\n<p>As far as precipitation goes, this is also an area where the tent&apos;s performance depends on the intensity and duration of the rain as well as its condition.</p>\n<p>The seams have not been sealed, which is not ideal in this regard, but in light rain conditions, the canopy may still be able to keep you relatively dry (assuming, of course, the rain is not blowing in through the sides).</p>\n<p>The UPF 50+ UV protection which the canopy provides may help <a href=\"/blog/finding-the-right-beach-tent\">safeguard your health</a>. Just keep in mind that you still may need to use sunscreen, especially since earlier and later in the day, the rays of the sun will be able to strike you directly through the open sides of the canopy tent. Thankfully, there is a side wall accessory which can help.</p>\n<h3>Transport and Setup</h3>\n<p>When you purchase this canopy tent, you receive a storage bag that can also be used for transportation. Since it is carry-on friendly, you should even be able to bring it with you when you travel. The bag has wheels and comfortable leather handles. With its 49&rdquo; x 9&rdquo; dimensions, it should fit easily in most vehicle trunks.</p>\n<p>Hypothetically, you can set up this tent by yourself without assistance. You may find it easier with a second person helping you, however, especially if you are doing so for the first time. Either way, it probably will not take you more than several minutes.</p>\n<p>Once the tent has been set up, it provides you with 100 square feet in which to enjoy the shade. Note that while the product description says that about 15 people could comfortably occupy this space, a more realistic number would be around 4-6 maximum.</p>\n<h3>Aesthetics</h3>\n<p>This tent looks pretty much like any other pop up canopy tent, and is emblazoned with the name &ldquo;Leader Associates&rdquo; along with the company&rsquo;s triangular logo. You can choose from a number of colors: green, blue, silver, tan, or dark gray.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/leader-canopy.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Leader Accessories Canopy Tent\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Cool Features and Accessories</h3>\n<p>Having gone over the appearance of the tent, setup and transportation, durability, <a href=\"/blog/tent-materials\">canopy materials</a>, and sun and rain protection features, let&apos;s talk about a few more features and accessories which stand out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The height as well as the pull strings on the tent are easily adjustable.</li>\n<li>You get a set of accessories with your purchase, including the pull strings, steel stakes, and carry bag you need. Optionally, you can also purchase a windshield side wall if desired.</li>\n<li>The two air vents in the canopy are able to improve stability while providing ventilation.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/leader-sidewall.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Leader Accessories Canopy Tent Sidewall\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It&apos;s fast and relatively simple for one person to set up this tent. A second person may make the process significantly easier however.</li>\n<li>The tent is well ventilated and provides adequate sun protection as well as some shelter from rainfall.</li>\n<li>Transporting this canopy tent is easy, and the dimensions are suitable for car trunks or carry-on.</li>\n<li>This canopy tent can stand up to mild wind.</li>\n<li>You can choose from a few different colors so that your tent reflects your personality.</li>\n<li>The option to purchase a side wall is nice, and not something which every manufacturer has thought of for open designs like this one. This can be very helpful not only with blocking wind, but also light as the sun is rising or falling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stability is not the best at the highest height setting.</li>\n<li>Under some circumstances, the tent might leak in the rain.</li>\n<li>Especially strong winds may damage the tent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We think this 10x10 Leader Canopy Tent is certainly worth consideration. But on the surface, it doesn&apos;t really jump out from the crowd. Its dimensions, features, materials, and <a href=\"/blog/canopy-tent-accessories\">tent accessories</a> are pretty standard and straightforward.</p>\n<p>It is however durable and stable enough to do the job time and again if you take care of it and do not expose it to harsh wind conditions. For a reliable and simple tent which is ideal for travel and perfect for personal or professional use, the Leader Accessories Instant Canopy pop up Canopy delivers a great bang for your buck.</p>','/img/leader-canopy-on-beach.jpg','Review'),('legit-double-hammock',24,'Legit Double Hammock review','A great product to stick in your bag along side your rain tent.','Matt Bryant','October 6, 2018','<h4>Preface</h4>\n<p>A reader got into touch with us last week and told us about his latest camping trip. He had purchased a tent from our list of the <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">best waterproof tents</a> and spent a weekend with his friends enjoying the great outdoors. He mentioned that two products left the biggest impression on him. First was his rain tent, but second was a hammock that he had recently purchased. He sent us a review of the hammock, which we decided to include. We love hearing for our readers and want to pass along any recommendations we can. So here it is.</p>\n<h4>Intro</h4>\n<p>Legit Camping is following a business plan that I strongly support. Make one product and make it well. If you are shopping for a double camping hammock, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2E2qQVx\">Legit Double Hammock</a> is my pick for best value. It is priced competitively for any single-person hammock, even amongst those that are significantly lesser in quality.</p>\n<h4>First Impression</h4>\n<p>The hammock ships inside of its permanently attached stuff sack. Whenever I opened the box, my immediate impression was that the hammock looks “cool”. It has a little bit of a wow factor, especially if you are any kind of outdoor gear-head. The brand sports a logo that looks trendy. The black silhouette sloth reminds me of Backcountry’s logo. It looks great centered on the front of the two-tone stuff sack.</p>\n<p>The hammock comes with everything you need to start lounging. Carabiners and tree straps are included so you could take this out of the box, stick it right in your backpack, and hit the trail if you wanted.</p>\n<p>The hammock can be purchased in many different color combinations. Mine is red and grey, and is very visible when set up. Again, I feel like this hammock has a “cool” factor that many of the other hammocks that I have seen don’t have. The parachute material has a slight sheen to it that draws your eye. Whenever I set mine up in populated areas, I often wind up answering questions about it to interested people who walk by. I like to brag every now and then, so I don’t mind it.</p>\n<h4>Quality</h4>\n<p>The tree straps are thick and padded so that they do not damage the bark. The only part of a hammock that touches, and therefore impacts, the environment is the straps. So, I like to see Legit Camping making an effort to ensure that their product has as low of an impact as possible. The tree saver straps are long enough that you can attach them to any reasonably sized tree. It would be hard to find a tree in the northeastern United States (that’s where I live) that would be too thick for the straps. The tree saver straps serve multiple purposes. They protect the tree bark, they ensure that the rope that goes around the tree won’t fray due to friction with coarse tree bark, and they add an additional element of friction to make sure that the straps don’t slip down the trunk of the tree.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n    	<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2E2qQVx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    		<img src=\"/img/legit-double-hammock-components.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Waterproof Legit Double Hammock\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;\"/>\n    	</a>\n        <p class=\"text-center\"><small>Click image to see Legit Double Hammock on Amazon</small></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>The hammock is made from high quality 210T Nylon. This is the same type of material that parachutes are made from because it is durable and light weight. The hammock is constructed well. It has a single stich along the edge of the fabric, which is all you really need. This stitch is for looks and to prevent fraying. Legit Camping uses triple stitching on seams that support pressure such as where one piece of fabric connects to another and in the loops at each end of the hammock. Whenever I see hammocks rip, it is usually at one of these locations so I like to see that Legit Camping triple stitched these seams.</p>\n<p>Another feature that I like about this hammock is that it uses double cords instead of a single cord. Many of the cheaper products I have reviewed only use one. By using double cords at the anchor points and inside the tree straps, Legit Camping ensures that their product can support up to 400lbs.</p>\n<p>I really like the fact that the stuff sack is attached. It looks a little goofy because the hammock is sleek and the stuff sack looks like it doesn’t belong. But it is pragmatic. First, I don’t have to worry about losing it. I’d be embarrassed to tell you how many stuff sacks I have lost on camping trips so I appreciate not having to worry about losing another one. The other benefit to the attached stuff sack is actually an unintended feature. It functions as a pocket. The first night I camped in it, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had a convenient spot to store my valuables before I fell asleep. The attached stuff sack spoiled me, and I now find it inconvenient when hammocks don’t have anywhere to store the items that I might need during the night.</p>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>Setup is easy. You wrap the included tree straps around the tree and feed the loop back through itself. The loop makes the straps act like a choker collar. When you lay in the hammock, the straps tighten around the tree, ensuring that the straps don’t slip down the trunk. Once you have the straps pulled tight, you can use the included carabiner to attach each end of the hammock to the tree. You can make knots in the slack from the tree strap to control the tautness of your hammock so that your hammock doesn’t droop. Out of the box, I set this hammock up in under 2 minutes.</p>\n<h4>Drawbacks</h4>\n<p>I don’t have many negative things to say about this hammock, but I will point out a few issues that I found. First, it is very uncomfortable to sleep in any two-person hammock that doesn’t have cross supports. Whenever a person lays in a hammock, gravity pulls him or her to the center. Whenever you put two people into a hammock, gravity pulls both of them into the center. The two people are squeezed against each other, which makes sleeping unpleasant. Cross supports prevent this from happening because the rigid supports prevent the hammock from folding on itself. But this hammock doesn’t have cross supports because it is a camping hammock. Camping hammocks value portability, so you never find cross supports in any camping hammock. Although this hammock is marketed as a double hammock, I do not recommend it for two people.</p>\n<p>My next issue is that there isn’t enough cord included with the hammock. It is rare that you find two trees that are at a perfect distance from each other. In the real world, you need to use extra cord to anchor your hammock to two trees that are too far apart. The tree straps that are included are not long enough to anchor to trees that aren’t within that 3-foot ideal range, so you will need to bring your own cord in addition to the included contents.</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>Overall, I am thrilled with my Legit Camping Double Hammock as a single person hammock. It is light weight, durable, and comfortable. It has an appealing design and quality components. I own a lot of hammocks, but I find myself grabbing my Legit Camping Double Hammock whenever I am going backpacking because it is a cool little hammock that is fun to show off.</p>\n<p>So you purchased a hot tub or inflatable hot tub and your looking for some accessories to upgrade it?</p>','/img/legit-double-hammock.jpg','Review'),('lightspeed-outdoors-sun-shelter',5,'Unboxing the Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter','Getting my hands dirty with one of the best sun shelters on the market.','Kenneth Huebsch','July 17, 2017','<p>I grew up on the east coast and was fortunate enough to be raised by a set of parents who loved trips to the beach. Throughout the years it has been interesting to see how trends change at the shore. Of course I noticed the changes in fashion, hairstyles, automobiles, and music. But, I also witnessed a change in what items people brought with them to the beach. Before the new millennium, the beach umbrella was the most common source of shade for beach-goers. There were variations that attached to chairs, variations that stuck into the sand, and others that needed to be held. Umbrellas served their purpose and were the primary provider of shade for vacationers until the late 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aluminum frame pop-up canopy tent didn’t gain popularity until the early 2000s. The early designs from the 1980s were feeble and difficult to set up. People didn’t really start bringing them to the beach until the telescoping legs and collapsing frame were perfected. Once pop-up canopies became durable, affordable, and easy to set up, they became popular amongst beach-goers. Over the last 15 years or so, the pop-up canopy has edged out the beach umbrella as the most popular sunshade at the shore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article would be incomplete if it could ended there, though. Canopy Tent Reviews has traditionally focused on the aluminum frame pop-up canopy. But in order to bring our readers the most accurate and up-to-date reviews, we are forced to change with the times. Over the past few years I have seen a new product gaining popularity and I believe that it is only a matter of time before it overtakes the pop-up canopy tent as the most popular source of shelter on the beach. The product that I am referring to does not have an industry standard name yet because it is so new. Some manufacturers call them beach shades, others call them beach tents, and still others call them sun shades. All of these terms are synonymous with the revolutionary new product that is hitting the market like a storm. There are many variations, but the most common design is more similar to a traditional camping tent than a canopy tent. They are about 4 to 5 feet tall and use tent poles instead of a collapsible metal frame. Beach tents are smaller and weigh less than canopy tents, which make them more suitable for beach use. They provide enough shelter to sit or lay under, which is typically the only shelter that most vacationers need because, lets be realistic… The reason vacationers usually go to the beach is to lay out in the sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we realized how great these new products are, we decided that in order to provide the best canopy tent reviews to our readers we needed to expand our portfolio and review the best beach tents as well. We walked our local beaches and talked to beach tent owners to ask their opinions and get product recommendations. We used these recommendations to put together a list of products that we would review, condense, and rank. One of the most popular recommendations that we received was a beach tent from Lightspeed Outdoors, which was a company that I hadn’t heard of. I reached out to the brand and was immediately impressed with the quality of their customer service. Responses were prompt and genuine and I got the feeling that I was talking to somebody who really cared about my relationship with the brand. I’ve been reviewing canopy tents for a while and have had my fair share of unpleasant experiences so it was refreshing to be treated like a customer should be. By the end of the week, one was on the way to our warehouse. I find it funny that even though we’ve reviewed an abundance of canopy tents, I was still excited for this new beach tent to arrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>First Impression</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The product that was recommended to me and that I asked to review is the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2uxu90T\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter</a>. It arrived in a long skinny 3 foot by 6 inch box that tightly housed all all of the contents. I like to store my canopy tents in their boxes for extra protection when I am not using them. The box it ships in is worth keeping. The only item inside the box was the carry bag which contained the sun shelter and all of its components. The carry bag is made of strong grey polyester with a neon green shoulder strap. The contrast between the two colors and the subtle white logo on the polyester makes the bag look very modern. The instructions and product information are attached to the inside of the carry bag and contain a set of instructions that is clear, concise, and easy to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ls-bag.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter Carry Bag\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The carry bag holds two items: the sun shelter and the stake bag. The stake bag was the same neon green as the strap and contained 8 thick plastic stakes. One of the main concerns that I voiced in a previous article, picking the <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com/blog/best-beach-canopy\">best pop up canopy for the beach</a>, was that the stakes that are included by most canopy tent manufacturers are not suitable for use in the sand. This is not a concern with the Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter, though. They are thick and ribbed and are designed to withstand abuse while remaining firmly anchored into a sandy foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ls-bag-contents.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter Components\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The sun shelter ships tightly wrapped and secured with a red strap and buckle. I like how Lightspeed Outdoors thought about the details and didn’t cut corners when designing their product. The brand could have chosen to include cheap aluminum stakes and not included a fastening strap, and possibly made an extra dollar or two per sale. But, they chose to include quality components and pay attention to the details and I commend the brand for that. Once I removed the strap, the poles which form the frame of the sun shelter fell open from gravity. When the shelter was laying on the ground open, I could see how the poles and joints were engineered and could figure out what I needed to do to set it up without reading the instructions. But the instructions, which are conveniently sewed to the inside of the carry bag, are easy to follow so setup should be a breeze for everybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Setup</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Lightspeed Outdoors is not the only company that manufactures beach tents. Most of the beach canopies that we have reviewed are constructed with satisfactory quality, so we really look hard for unique features that separate a product from the crowd. It was not difficult to find the distinguishing feature that separates the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2uxu90T\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter</a> from the crowd. The sun shelter is easier to set up than any beach tent I have reviewed. The frame design is unlike anything I have ever seen and gives Lightspeed Outdoors’ product a leg up on any other beach sun shelter currently on the market.</p>\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ls-setup-1.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter setup step 1\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ls-setup-2.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter setup step 2\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ls-setup-3.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter setup step 3\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To set up the shelter I unclipped the strap which allowed the legs to fall open freely. Next I grabbed the center frame support and raised it to about eye level. Lastly I pulled the pull-cord towards me, which made the tent poles extend and lock into position. It was incredibly simple. The whole process took less than 10 seconds. The entire process of opening the sealed box and setting the beach tent up to be ready for use can be accomplished in under 2 minutes. The product comes completely assembled and ready to use. Most of the other sun shelters that we have reviewed require you to stake the shelter down first and then slide tent poles through sleeves, which is a setup procedure common to traditional camping tents. Although this process isn’t difficult, it often takes 3 minutes or more. The pull-cord setup procedure of the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2uxu90T\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter</a> is much easier and convenient. Also, it gives users the freedom to skip staking down the shelter if it is not needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>On The Beach</h4>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ls-sun-shelter.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter on the beach\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the product was set up, my first impression was that it was pretty cool looking. The color combination for the sun shelter that I reviewed was grey, green, and deep red. These colors contributed to a sleek design that make it catch the eye. Another characteristic of the shelter that became evident once it was set up was the attention to detail that Lightspeed Outdoors paid while designing their shelter. The exterior comes with additional nylon loops and tie down cords pre-attached which allows you to anchor the shelter from a much more stable position. All of the seams are double stitched and the edges of the canopy are finished with additional polyester trim, adding to my impression that this product is made with high quality. The polyester is thick enough that it won’t tear easily. It will provide water resistance and more importantly protection from ultraviolet radiation. The fabric is rated UPF 50+ so the product really does provide shelter from the sun. I also like that the shelter uses exterior hooks to attach the fabric to the frame. If you need to disassemble the shelter for cleaning, separating the frame from the tent is as easy as removing a few plastic clips and removing the tent poles from the eyeholes at the base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior has some nice features as well. There are three mesh net windows that can be closed with interior flaps. They are closed by hooking the corner of each window flap on a plastic hook. It is a simple process. The shelter has a floor that serves dual purposes. The first, and more obvious, purpose is that it provides a barrier from the sand. The floor extends out front past the footprint of the shelter so users can lay fully extended on the floor and not touch the sand if they want to. The extended floor facilitates the second purpose which is to provide a privacy barrier. The floor can be folded up and hooked to the ceiling of the shelter to completely seal off the interior. This is a valuable feature because it gives users the ability to hide valuables or it can provide privacy if they need to change clothes, change a baby, or find themselves in any other situation where they need to escape a crowd.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ls-sealed.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter sealed\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tear Down</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It is as easy to pack the Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter as it is to set it up. Once the user pulls down on the frame connection fitting, the entire shelter becomes limp and collapses. After that, packing the shelter is similar to putting away an umbrella. First the poles get folded inwards and then the fabric is wrapped around the outside of the collapsed frame. This process takes about 30 seconds and when it is done, the whole sun shelter fits nicely back into its carry bag.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Summary</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I can’t say enough good things about the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2uxu90T\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter</a>. My compliments start with the brand and their outlook on customer service and extend genuinely to their product. The shelter is made with quality and attention to detail that that separates it as one of the best sun shelters on the market. The innovative frame design that allows setup to be just a few seconds takes it a step farther and puts it into the argument for the best beach tent on the market. I like that it has the capability to be sealed off for privacy and I also like that separating the frame from the fabric is as easy as removing a few hooks. All in all, I think that the Lightspeed Outdoors Sun shelter is arguably the best sun shelter on the market in terms of value for the money. Pay attention over the next few years as you go to the beach because I would be willing to bet that you are going to notice two things. First of all you are going to see beach umbrellas and pop-up canopy tents being replaced by beach sun shelters. And next you are going to see that more and more of those beach sun shelters are made my Lightspeed Outdoors.</p>','/img/sandy-beach.png','Review'),('national-park-planning',66,'Tips for Planning Your National Park Vacation','Park permits are selling out the day they are released. Make sure you well prepared for your next national park camping trip.','Courtney Mann','August 22, 2021','<p>We’ve had a strange, unprecedented couple of years. Most of us spent 2020 cooped up in our homes during the lockdown. And now that 2021 has rolled around and many people have gotten vaccinated, they are eager to get back out into the world. As a result, national and state parks are overwhelmed with visitors right now, and we are seeing bookings stretching far in advance for the rest of the year.</p> \n\n<p>In this post, we are going to tell you a bit more about the floods of vacationers making a rush on outdoor parks, as well as what you can do to prepare successfully for a state park <a href=\"/blog/autumn-camping-survival-guide\">camping trip of your own</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Demand for State Park Camping Permits Has Soared</h2>\n\n<p>To get a feel for how crazy demand is right now, let’s take a look at a few recent news posts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chronline.com/stories/washington-parks-expect-lots-of-visitors-sold-out-campsites-this-summer,268591\" target=\"_blank\">The Chronicle posted</a> on July 5th about how campsites are selling out at Washington parks. Offering some examples, the article says, &quot;At many parks, campsites have been selling like hot cakes this season. Take Kanaskat-Palmer State Park in Ravensdale: weekend campsite reservations began selling out in March 2021, where they usually begin selling out in June, said Park Aide Ryan LaRont. Recently, the park has started to sell out on weekdays as well. LaRont used to refer visitors to Dash Point State Park in Federal Way when Kanaskat-Palmer sold out, but that isn’t always an option anymore.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Because of the high demand, some parks are starting to increase camping costs as well. <a href=\"https://www.travelawaits.com/2670011/idaho-state-parks-camping-fees-rising/\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> is a post that explains how camping rates have doubled for non-residents who are staying at Idaho state parks.</p>\n\n<p>There are also destinations that did not require reservations in the past, but do require them now. For example, <a href=\"https://www.outtherecolorado.com/multimedia/list-reservations-now-required-at-many-iconic-destinations-in-colorado/collection_f0ad51ee-c7da-11eb-ac50-a70ad17f71c6.html\" target=\"_blank\">Out There Colorado says</a>, &quot;Thanks to new restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with general overcrowding, several popular destinations in Colorado now require visitors to have reservations. Here’s a glimpse at some of the iconic destinations where reservations are required, including Rocky Mountain National Park, Hanging Lake, Mount Evans, and more.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In these locations, you not only need to book camping, but also book a reservation to simply enter the parks.</p>\n\n<h2>What Should You Do to Plan Your 2021 State Park Trip?</h2>\n\n<p>Keeping in mind all of the changes taking place, how can you prepare for a successful state park vacation in 2021?</p>\n\n<h3>1. Check what reservations you need to place, and book them as early as possible.</h3>\n\n<p>As soon as you can, start researching what kinds of reservations you need to make. Do not assume that once you have booked your campsite, you are all good to go. You may also need to place a reservation for timed entry to the park.</p>\n\n<p>But that depends on the park. In some cases, just placing a service reservation (like a campsite booking) is all you need. Only someone who is not making such a reservation might have to make a timed-entry reservation.</p> \n\n<p>Also be aware that you may have to pay an entry fee separate from your reservation.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Be prepared to pay higher fees than usual to camp.</h3>\n\n<p>Speaking of fees, they are higher than they used to be for some parks, so check them in advance. You do not want to be caught off guard.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Check for closures before you go, and follow all COVID-19 rules and restrictions.</h3>\n\n<p>Since new variants of COVID-19 are floating around, it is possible that there will be more lockdowns at parks and local businesses during 2021.</p> \n\n<p>For that reason, even if you have a reservation for a state park, you should double-check before you head out to make sure that there are no active or imminent lockdowns.</p>\n\n<p>You would not want to show up at the gate only to find it is closed!</p>\n\n<p>When you arrive, follow all restrictions for your safety and that of other visitors. That means, for example, wearing a mask if you are not vaccinated, and observing appropriate social distancing protocols.</p> \n\n<h3>4. Check what amenities will be available.</h3>\n\n<p>The Guardian reports, &quot;If you do plan to visit a national park, be prepared for changing conditions – and don’t expect your visit will look like your pre-pandemic trips. Glacier, for instance, has not yet finalized decisions about which campgrounds will be open this summer, or whether the park’s shuttle buses will be in operation. In other popular parks, like Yosemite, shuttles, tours, and some visitors’ attractions will be closed for the summer, while dining areas will operate with COVID precautions, including social distancing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So, if you need to, call ahead to find out what amenities you can expect. You do not want to find yourself with plans you cannot pursue.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Bring the right supplies to enjoy a comfortable camping trip.</h3>\n\n<p>Particularly since amenities may be limited, you will want to put extra time and thought into packing for your <a href=\"/blog/winter-camping-guide\">camping trip</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bring a rugged, roomy <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">waterproof tent</a> where you can stay <a href=\"/blog/rain-camping-checklist\">cozy and dry</a> for the duration of your stay.</p>\n \n <div class=\"row\">\n 	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n 		<img src=\"/img/biker-camping-in-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Mountain biker in waterproof tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n 	</div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<p>Also pack sleeping pads, pillows, backpacks, sunscreen, canteens, first aid supplies, food, basic repair tools, flashlights, layers of clothing, and personal supplies.</p> \n\n<h3>6. As always, leave no trace.</h3>\n\n<p>Last but not least, plan to be kind to our nation’s state and national parks. These are protected natural areas that are home to fragile ecosystems and geological features.</p> \n\n<p>Leaving no trace is important any time you visit a park, but with so many visitors crowding the parks this year, it is more important than ever to do all you can to minimize your impact.</p>\n\n<h2>Make Your Reservations ASAP To Enjoy Your 2021 State Park Vacation.</h2>\n\n<p>Now you have our recommendations for how to make the most of your state park vacation in 2021. Get those bookings in as soon as you can to beat the rush, and pack supplies like a <a href=\"/blog/waterproof-tent-features\">waterproof tent</a> so you can stay comfortable during your visit to the great outdoors.</p> ','/img/el-capitan.jpg','Camping'),('neso-grande-beach-canopy',53,'Neso Grande Beach Canopy Review','Getting my hands dirty with the top rated beach canopy tent.','Eric Schroeder','January 28, 2020','<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Before digging into the Grande review, let’s first learn a little bit more about the history behind the Neso brand because we think it’s an important part of the story and the development of this product.</p>\n<p>Diagnosed with early-stage melanoma as a young adult, founder Matt Goldberg knew first hand that getting too much sun at the beach was a real problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Fortunately, Matt has since recovered and is healthy but his experience forever changed his outlook on sun protection.</p>\n<p>As a new father, he wanted to ensure that his young daughter had plenty of shade while playing at the beach near their home in Southern California. So in early 2014 when a friend approached him with the idea, Matt’s engineering background kicked in and thought it would be a great passion project that had potential to disrupt the massive sunshade market and become the <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">best beach canopy</a> tent.</p>\n<p>After a few rough sketches (and probably some long nights), he found a manufacturer that could produce the Neso 1 at scale and meet the quality standard he demanded. Armed with a few rounds of samples and pending patents, Matt took to Kickstarter to test the market for a lightweight, stake-less, easy to carry, easy to set up, sunshade tent. Within 45 short days, the Neso 1 had received nearly <em>triple</em> the original funding goal and validated to him other people were as interested in it as he was. This campaign would kickstart the brand to becoming a huge success in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-1\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-kickstarter-notepad.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Kickstarter sketches\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-2\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-kickstarter-notepad-2.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Kickstarter sketches\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>Since then, Neso has not only continued to improve their product quality but innovate with new products and tent sizes welcoming the Grande (110” x 110”) and Gigante (134” x 134”) tents a few short years later. Their goal, simply put, is to help people enjoy themselves because that is what life is about.</p>\n<p>We couldn’t agree more!</p>\n<p>We’ll start by saying that we’ve enjoyed having a front-row seat in witnessing a gradual shift in the beach canopy market over the past few years. Where the 10x10 canopy tent reigned supreme on beaches for the last decade or more, customers are now favoring more lightweight, portable designs that are much easier to transport and set up. And as we head into the summer of 2020, we think this trend will only accelerate and these lightweight options will continue to grow as the preferred option for beach sunshade tents.</p>\n<p>So to keep up we, got our hands on the Neso Grande tent in the coral color and we’re thrilled to review it from top to bottom. We’ll focus on the quality and type of materials, highlight the features, the functionality, ease of use, things that set it apart, things to consider, and ultimately give our recommendation. Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>Quality and Materials</h2>\n<h3>Carrying Bag</h3>\n<p>The Grande canopy arrived in a 19.5” softshell black bag with a nylon over-the-shoulder strap. There is a nice drawstring with a thumb release lock to cinch the bag and make sure nothing falls out when in transit or storage, pretty standard for most canopy carrying bags.</p>\n<p>The first thing we noticed is that the carrying bag seems to be of high quality and feels as though it will hold up to repeated use and abuse, the top thing we look for in carrying bags. On the front pouch, the parts included are on the top of the list of bullet points, so it&apos;s easy to take a quick inventory and know exactly what to expect when first opening the carrying case.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-carrying-bag.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Carrying Bag for Neso Grande\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Cooler Pocket</h4>\n<p>The front pouch is Velcro-locked, and we were quickly reminded by the foil-like space blanket material that the listing said there was a cooler inside, and it’s surprisingly big. With enough room to comfortably fit 4 adult beverages (a friend told me), this front pouch is also a great place to store keys, a cell phone, snacks, or other small items that you might carry to the beach, possibly removing the need to bring an extra bag. The Neso 1 bag does not offer the cooler pocket, and while some might think it’s gimmicky and unnecessary, we think it’s a great addition to the Grande carrying case.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-carrying-bag-cooler.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Carrying Bag Cooler for Neso Grande\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>Assembly instructions are listed just below the parts section of the front cooler pouch, but if you’re a visual learner like us we recommend to go ahead and open the bag and remove the parts before taking a close look at the set-up instructions. Retaining the assembly instructions, albeit short, most likely isn’t going to happen without seeing the parts inside the bag and you’ll find yourself re-reading them once everything is out.</p>\n<p>Upon loosening the drawstring and opening the tent bag, the first thing we noticed is that there are two separate compartments. On one side is the canopy itself, and the other side is the aluminum support poles. This is a nice feature because each of these fit snuggly on their side, and you won’t have to worry about one getting in the way of the other when it’s time to pack up.</p>\n<h3>Canopy</h3>\n<p>We first removed the canopy material from the bag. We’ll start by saying that the Lycra/Nylon blend \n  <a href=\"/blog/tent-materials\">fabric feels amazing</a>. For those that don’t know, Lycra is a spandex or elastane material made of \n  <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">synthetic fibers</a> that is well known for its exceptional elasticity and offers incomparable 4-way stretch. This type of fabric and quality isn’t something we come across often when reviewing canopy tents. Denier polyester with a polyurethane lining serves as the most common material on canopy and beach tents because of its lightweight and sun and water-resistant features. But this Lycra/Nylon blend is on another level.\n</p>\n<h4>Sun Protection</h4>\n<p>Neso says the fabric is UPF 50+, giving it the best ultraviolet protection rating and considered to provide excellent levels of sun protection. You may have guessed it, but UPF is an acronym for ultraviolet protection factor which is a rating scale on fabric and clothing similar to SPF is on sunscreen for our skin. The UPF scale ranges from 15 to 50+, so this canopy is as good as it gets when it comes to protecting your skin from the sun&apos;s harmful UVA and UVB rays. Rest assured that those underneath the canopy will be protected.</p>\n<h4>Water Resistance</h4>\n<p>Another great feature of this Lycra/Nylon canopy blend is its water-resistant and \n  <a href=\"/blog/waterproof-tent-features\">water repellent properties</a>. We ran the canopy under water to test this claim, and we’ll admit it was very cool to watch. The water beaded right off and didn’t even get the fabric wet. Touching the canopy immediately afterward felt as though it had never touched any water and was as dry as it was out of the bag. Neso doesn’t advertise this tent to be waterproof, but we wanted to test it anyway because we were so impressed with the way the water reacted when it came in contact with the fabric. We created a pool of water on the fabric, and it took a few minutes but it eventually, unsurprisingly, did permeate through the tent onto the ground below.\n</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-water-resitance.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Water dripping off Neso fabric\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Edges and Stitching</h4>\n<p>The stitching of the edges and the thread is much improved over the Neso 1. We’re not textile experts so its difficult to say the type of stitching used, we can say it appears to be a newer stitch type with reinforced thread over previous versions of Neso tents. It’s always a point of concern for us because the stitching and thread are typically the first points of failure in a design of this nature. When being pulled tautly, a Lycra/Nylon always has a great 4-way stretch, but the stitching and the thread does not. This usually results in fraying or loosening of the thread on an edge near a corner, and a chain reaction ensues that can easily destroy the entire canopy. That doesn’t seem likely here with these engineering improvements, and this quality and attention to detail are what’s going to keep customers happy and coming back.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-1\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-center-seam-stitching.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Center Seam\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-2\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-edges-stitching.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Edge Seam\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Reinforced Corners</h4>\n<p>In addition to the edges, we wanted to pay particularly close attention to the corners of the canopy because we knew this is where a lot of stress on the canopy is located. It’s easy to see very quickly when comparing this Grande to early Neso 1 tents that the entire corner construction has been revamped and reinforced. A new stitching technique was used to prevent or eliminate tearing and fraying around the edges of the corner. A reinforced metal grommet is located near the center of the corner construction, where the nylon rope of the anchor bag is looped through and connected by a girth hitch knot. Because they’re already tethered and connected right out of the bag, there is no additional assembly required which is a very nice feature helping to save time during the initial set up.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-1\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-old-stitching.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Old Stitching\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-2\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-corner-new-stitching.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso New Stitching\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Anchor Bag</h3>\n<p>Made from the same Lycra/Nylon blend as the canopy, we found the \n  <a href=\"/blog/canopy-weights\">anchor bags</a> to be high quality and unique way to keep this tent securely grounded. The cool thing about these is that they aren’t bags, more like flat pieces of the fabric that become bags when filled with sand and cinched closed. The rope used to cinch the bag closed and that connects to the canopy is thick nylon that adequately handles the tension when the aluminum poles are raised under the tent pulling the line taut.\n</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-anchor-bag.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Anchor Bag\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Aluminum Poles</h3>\n<p>We next removed the aluminum poles from the carrying bag. All Neso tents come included with two aluminum support poles to prop the tent. The first thing we want to highlight on the poles is the aluminum construction. Aluminum has two properties that greatly outrank the common steel frame construction found on most 10x10 pop up canopy tents. First, aluminum weighs significantly less than steel because it is less dense, usually by a factor of 2.5 times. This is one of the main reasons this lightweight tent weighs in at only 6.5 lbs., making it highly portable.</p>\n<p>The second benefit of aluminum is that it is rust-proof. This is particularly important for beach tents due to contact with saltwater. Saltwater is a very good conductor of dissociated ions, and several electrolysis reactions accelerate corrosion in saltwater. Because you know, chemistry and stuff. We typically find that steel legs become rusted after just a few times of coming in contact with saltwater, which is why most manufacturers powder-coat their steel. This does help prevent rusting, but it will over time wear down and become rusted. Aluminum is the superior choice in our opinion.</p>\n<p>Each pole is broken down into five pieces, all interconnected with a high-quality shock cord running through the center of the pole. This makes assembly super easy because the elasticity of the shock cord pulls each piece together as there are stretched out. There is a foam ball on top of the pole which we found to be awesome because it adheres to the Lycra/Nylon blend very well without slipping, and keeps the pole in place when wedged between sand and the tent. The rounded ball also prevents any possible sharp edges that might come in contact with the canopy fabric causing it to slice or rip.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-1\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-shock-cord-pole.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Poles\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-md-offset-2\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-foam-ball-pole.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Foam Ball\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>The last thing we love about these poles is that they’re not telescoping. Most pop up canopy tents have one-piece telescoping legs that slide into each other. The problem with these legs for beach use is when they come into contact with sand. Over time, sand inevitably becomes lodged in the sliding legs and thumb release locking buttons causing grinding and breakdown of the mechanisms. By having the shock cord and interconnecting pieces of the Neso poles, this completely removes the possibility of sand becoming stuck in between two pieces of metal causing breakdown.</p>\n<p>Each pole is 6’ 11” (83” total) which is a very nice height and which allowed us to stand underneath, compared to the Neso 1 at 5’ 6” (66” total) which we found to be a bit too short for our liking.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>Once we had all of the materials out of the carrying bag, it was time to set up the tent. Following the instructions on the front cooler pouch, the first thing we did was lay the tent flat and stretch each of the anchor bags as far as possible making a big “X”.</p>\n<p>With each anchor bag laying flat, we filled them with as much sand as possible until they were overflowing. Then we pulled on the nylon rope of the bag and cinched the anchor bags shut. We then pulled the bags outwards again making sure to pull the Lycra/Nylon canopy fabric as taut as possible. It is very important to stretch the tent out as much as possible. Pulling it completely taut will create downward pressure on the aluminum poles, keeping them securely wedged between the sand and the fabric.</p>\n<p>We connected each of the aluminum poles and propped up two corners of the tent. There are two <em>very important</em> things to consider when positioning the poles underneath the tent. The first is that they each need to be 1 foot, toward the center, from the corners. This relieves some of the tension on the corner construction and will provide the most stability.</p>\n<p>The second very important consideration of the pole position is to help stabilize the tent during windy conditions. The trick here is to always position the poles so that the wind is flowing directly under the beach tent. For example, if the wind is coming off the North, then position the poles on the north corners of the tent. This will prevent buckling of the aluminum poles and will keep your tent stabilized in the wind. Always position the poles on the same side of the canopy that the wind is coming from.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-set-up-coral.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Set Up\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Things to Consider</h2>\n<p>There are two things, in our opinion, that need to be brought into consideration before purchasing the Neso Grande. The first is that while this is an excellent beach canopy tent, for those looking to use it at other locations might be disappointed where sand is not readily available to fill the anchor bags. You can use rocks to fill the anchor bags, but that isn’t always a feasible option. We wish that stakes were included with the original purpose. We understand that a lot of the marketing around this tent is that it’s a stake-less design, but it would add a lot of functionality for those looking to use it at a soccer tournament or a park. It wouldn’t add any weight and the stakes are compact so they could fit inside an interior pouch of the carrying bag.</p>\n<p>However, you can purchase stakes on the Neso website or just reuse stakes if you have them from a previous canopy tent. If you do have them laying around, throw them in the cooler pouch so you don’t forget them if you find yourself in a pinch.</p>\n<p>The second consideration is the footprint that this tent takes up. For those of you on East Coast beaches, you might find there is simply no room to set up the tent with the close quarters and overcrowded beaches (looking at you NJ and MD). The footprint of a 10x10 canopy only takes up 100 sq. ft., but the Neso Grande can take up to 400 sq. ft. depending on how far you stretch the anchor bags. Something to consider if you plan on using it on a crowded beach.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/neso-grande-set-up.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Set Up Rear\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Recommendation</h2>\n<p>Upon completing the entire review, we can definitely say that in our opinion we think the Neso Grande is the best beach tent on the market. Our compliments start with their customer support and outlook on service and extend genuinely to their products. Their commitment to delivering a tent that has high-quality standards, innovative and thoughtful lightweight features, and unmatched functionality separates itself amongst all the other beach sunshade canopy tents.</p>\n<p>We’re still undecided as to what our favorite characteristic is of the Lycra/Nylon fabric; lightweight, durable, water resitant, sun protection, 4-way stretch, or just the cool coral color. No other beach tent will provide more square footage of shade at the same weight as a Neso tent. We love the lightweight aluminum poles and the anchor bags that are easy to cinch closed and keep the canopy securely grounded.</p>\n<p>In terms of setup and ease-of-use, this is one of the easiest tents to setup that we have ever reviewed. One person can quickly complete setup in under 4 minutes. Remember our tip with placing the poles on the same side as the wind, and you’ll be the envy of beachgoers everywhere you go. But be prepared, <em>everyone</em> will stop by your tent and ask what the brand name is and where you purchased it. We’re very confident we’re going to be seeing this more and more Neso tents on the beach this summer.</p>\n<p>Head on over to \n  <a href=\"http://neso.com\" target=\"_blank\">Neso.com</a> to check out all of their great beach products.\n</p>','/img/neso-grande-hero.jpg','Beach,Review'),('ocean-city-nj',36,'8 Things to Do in Ocean City, New Jersey','With summer right around the corner we take a look at the best things to do in one of the top rated New Jersey beaches','Hunter Farva','February 26, 2019','<p>If you are going to be visiting Ocean City, NJ, you&rsquo;re in for a treat.

Hike across the dunes and explore, go fishing, crabbing or boating, or just relax on the beach and take in the sun and the fresh, salty air.

The easily recognizable logo has been seen by nearly everyone at youth soccer tournaments or beach vacations in recent years. But the question is, is the popularity of this instant shelter a result of the quality of the tent or because Ozark Trail has prominent shelf space inside the largest retailer in the world as the brand is manufactured, distributed, and owned by Walmart? We wanted to do an in-depth review of this <a href=\"/\">popular instant shelter</a> and ultimately give our recommendation as to if this value brand tent is worth the lower price point vs. the higher quality but more expensive competition. Let&apos;s dig in.</p>\n \n <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/ozark-trail-10-x-10-instant-shelter.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Ozark Trail 10x10 Instant Shelter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n </div>\n <br />\n \n <h2>A Walmart owned brand</h2>\n <p>As previously mentioned but worth clarifying again as many buyers are unaware, Ozark Trail is the private label camping brand owned by Walmart. As such, they manufacture and distribute multiple product lines within the outdoor tent and camping industry under this brand name. Because of this, you won&apos;t be able to find a dedicated website for Ozark Trail to do your own due diligence. They are currently sold in Walmart stores, Amazon and other online 3rd party marketplaces; and at a pretty attractive price point.</p>\n <p>The most popular product in their line is the 10x10 Instant Slant Leg Tent with a blue canopy top. It is made with a steel construction frame and polyester material for the canopy, which is in line with just about every shade tent on the market today. The frame is that of a pyramid structure, which are generally found in all value brand canopy tents as they require less material to manufacture vs. that of a full truss system and as a result can keep the price lower.</p>\n <h2>The structure and pyramid frame</h2>\n <p>We typically see <a href=\"/blog/cross-truss-vs-pyramid\">pyramid frames</a> built with flimsy trusses and thin struts and reinforced (if you want to call it that) with cheaply made plastic joint connectors, and unfortunately this 10x10 Ozark canopy is no different. The biggest issue in all of this is the inability to withstand any rotational pressure during medium and high impact weather conditions as the joints become unstable and collapse at the mid points. In windy conditions high stress is applied to each side and the frame begins to break down at the unreinforced joint connectors. That is why we always recommend tents with a full truss structure as they are able to withstand rotational pressure since the cross section of the main support runs through the tent&apos;s center as opposed to outer perimeter.</p>\n <p>It&apos;s worth highlighting that despite the advertised dimensions of the 10x10 Ozark Trail, because this is a <a href=\"/blog/straight-vs-slant-legged-canopy\">slant leg</a> shelter the top only measures 8x8. While it might not sound like much, that is a difference of 64 sq. ft. vs 100 sq. ft. of shade coverage which we find to be quite significant. You&apos;ll be able to comfortably fit up to 4 chairs underneath the 64 sq. ft. of shade. The benefit of the slanted legs is that these tents are more stable laterally which can increase the stability of the frame and make it less prone to toppling, an important benefit if on a windy beach. Although we always recommend using anchors such as weighted sand bag or stakes with guy lines attached to the top corners.</p>\n <h3>Leg lock adjusters</h3>\n <p>The legs are locked into place with old school metal push button locks, something you won&apos;t see on many modern pop up tents now-a-days. These push locks get very difficult to use over time, especially if the tent is used on the beach and exposed to sand and saltwater, causing rust build up. Many newer tent brands like EZ-Up use revolutionary thumb lock sliders or larger easy to release buttons, which are a much better user experience when setting the canopy up or taking it down. With the push buttons you need to worry about pinching fingers or not being able to release the button when it gets rusted, which is never a pleasant experience. The legs extend to give the top peak a height of about 8&apos;10&quot; which will be plenty of headroom for anyone underneath.</p>\n <h3>Fabric and shade protection</h3>\n <p>The <a href=\"/blog/tent-materials\">canopy fabric</a> is made of a lightweight denier polyester, offering water resistant features and 50+ UPF, which we love. Being protected from the suns harmful UVB rays is probably why you wanted a canopy tent in the first place, and this Ozark Trail tent meets all criteria in this department. The one complaint we have is that there is no vents in the fabric at the peak to release the build up of hot air under the canopy. Most new tents incorporate this ventilated canopy design to increase airflow and reduce the trapping of hot air, helping to keep those in the shade cooler and more comfortable.</p>\n <p>In the event that your canopy fabic rips or tears, you can purchase a replacement canopy on Amazon or Walmart. However, at current prices for the replacement you&apos;re better off buying an entirely new Ozark canopy and you might even come out aheads vs. buying the replacement parts.</p>\n <h3>Weight and portability</h3>\n <p>The weight of this Ozark Trail is lighter than most of the same size alternative steel frame canopy tents, coming in right about 29 lbs. An argument can be made as to whether this is good or bad. From a positive perspective, the lightweight design increases portability which is certainly important in carrying the tent to its intended location. From a negative perspective, the weight is indicative of a lack of high quality material and components used throughout the shelter. The included carrying bag does not have wheels to aid in transportation, but at only 29 lbs. we don&apos;t find that to be a noteworthy drawback as the nylon handles and shoulder strap work just fine in carrying the tent.</p>\n <h3>Ozark Trail canopy accessories for camping</h3>\n <p>One thing we love about Ozark Trail canopy tents are the accessories that can be added to the shelters. &nbsp;These include sidewalls, weight bags, and a host of other great add-ons that can really increase the use and versatility of the canopy tent. Perhaps our two favorites are <a href=\"/blog/7-reasons-to-bring-a-canopy-tent-on-your-next-camping-trip\">camping</a> tent additions that connect to the frame of the shelter and leverage the stability of the 10x10 frame to support a camping tent structure.</p>\n <p>The first, and larger of the two options, is a 6-person tent that fastens to each of the valences truss bars and all 4 of the telescoping legs to turn your 10x10 pop up into a full blown camping tent that can accommodate up to 2 queen air mattresses. The second option is a smaller 4-person tent that connects to just one of the valence truss bars and two of the canopy legs. The result is a camping tent that sits outside of the pop up and provides a protected entrance for the main opening and creates something like that of a covered patio. This option accommodates 1 queen sized air mattress, perfect for a weekend getaway!</p>\n  <table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n      <tbody>\n          <tr>\n              <td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\">\n                  <h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ozark Trail 4-Person Camping Tent</h4>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\">\n                  <h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ozark Trail 6-Person Camping Tent&nbsp;</h4>\n              </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n              <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                  <div data-empty=\"true\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3y63Izl\"><img src=\"/img/ozark-trail-canopy-4-person-camping-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Ozark Trail 4-Person Camping Tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" /></a></div>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                  <div data-empty=\"true\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3n4C67C\"><img src=\"/img/ozark-trail-pop-up-6-person-camping-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Ozark Trail 6-Person Camping Tent\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" /></a></div>\n              </td>\n          </tr>\n      </tbody>\n  </table>\n <h2>Our recommendation</h2>\n <p>Overall, we think the Ozark Trail canopy serves its intended purpose - a value brand 10x10 instant shelter that caters to price conscious consumers looking for an <a href=\"/blog/best-canopy-tent-under-100\">affordable shade option</a>. And compared to some of the tents in the EZ-Up lineup, it sells for almost a 70% discount. One could, in theory, purchase a new Ozark canopy every year (which they might need to!) and still come out ahead over the years vs. purchasing a more expensive alternative.</p>\n <p>Our advice: just know that what you&apos;re buying is pretty cheaply made and with lower quality than many of the canopy tents on Amazon today. As mentioned, we tend to prefer and recommend full truss framed tents as they will last for years and are worth the investment. But if you have a smaller budget and you&apos;re willing to forego some bells and whistles, you&apos;ll still have a shade option in the Ozark Trail pop up canopy that will keep you adequately shaded anywhere you decide to use it - at least for a few seasons.</p>','/img/hero-ozark-trail-review.jpg','Review'),('pacific-breeze-sand-and-surf-shelter',6,'Unboxing the Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter','Digging my toes in the sand under one of the best full-overhead coverage beach tent on the market.','Kenneth Huebsch','August 09, 2017','<p>The past few years have been an interesting transitional period for the beach sun shelter market. In the early 2000s the pop-up canopy tent replaced the beach umbrella as the dominant sun shelter on the beach. The collapsible telescoping frame of the pop-up canopy tent was easier to set up and provided more coverage than the beach umbrella, which made it a more convenient option for beach-goers. The pop-up canopy tent has held it’s reign until the past few years. Over the past few years another product has gained significant market share amongst beach vacationers and will soon overtake the canopy tent as the most common form of shelter on the beach.</p>\n\n<p>The product that I am referring to has many names because it is new and an industry standard term hasn’t been widely agreed upon yet. Among a few other names, they are commonly referred to as Sun Shelters or Beach Tents. I am referring to the new product that is quickly \"popping up\" on beaches across the nation. These shelters are more closely related to camping tents than they are to canopy tents. Beach tents use fiberglass tent poles to support their fabric instead of an aluminum frame. This allows the entire product to weigh less than 10 lbs instead of the 40-50 lb range of the typical canopy tent. When consumers are walking from their car to the beach, they are usually already carrying more than they can handle. The last thing they want to do is to add an additional 45 lb canopy tent under one arm. The lightweight portable design of the new beach shelters are making them appealing to vacationers which is causing the new product to take the market by storm.</p>\n\n<p>The Canopy Tent Review team realizes that in order to provide our readers with the most up-to-date and accurate reviews and rankings, we must accept that the product that we have traditionally reviewed, the aluminum framed pop-up canopy tent, might not be the best sun shelter at the beach anymore. So we have branched from our comfort zone and have started testing out beach tents. We have been impressed with what we have seen so far.</p>\n\n<p>Pacific Breeze is one of the top beach tent brands right now. They manufacture three different quality beach tent variations, each with their own specific purposes. I like all of their products, but I was most interested in their <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2u7Jkyi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sand & Surf Shelter</a> because it is their biggest product and it is a completely different archatecture than the half-dome design that is common to the market. I reached out to Pacific Breeze and was impressed by the way I was treated. Customer Service is an important factor for me when evaluating products and brands, so I was happy that I was able to have a pleasant experience with the team at Pacific Breeze. Even though they are a company that is growing quickly, they still operate with an emphasis on customer service that I usually only see from mom-and-pop shops.</p>\n\n<h4>First Impression</h4>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2u7Jkyi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter</a> ships in a 38 x 6 inch light blue carry bag. It weighs right around 10 lbs and the carry bag has a strap so it is easy to carry the product over a shoulder when it is packed. I have transported many aluminum frame canopy tents and I usually wind up wheeling them behind me because they are too heavy to carry. Unfotunately, it isn’t possible to wheel the canopy around once the ground turns to sand. So I can see immediate benefits that this product has for use at the beach. The light blue bag with the black strap and white logo is an appealing color combination that really gives off beach vibes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n            <img src=\"/img/pb-bag.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Pacific Breeze Sand and Surf Shelter Carry Bag\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The carry bag contains two items, a stake bag and the beach tent. I wrote an article a few months ago on choosing the <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com/blog/best-beach-canopy\">best canopy tent for the beach</a>, and some of my biggest criticism was that manufacturers never include stakes that are suitable for sand. This is not the case with the Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter. The product ships with thick plastic stakes that will stay firmly entrenched in the sand through any reasonable weather conditions.</p>\n\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n\n<p>The canopy comes tightly wrapped and secured with a polyester strap. Whenever the polyester strap is removed the legs fall open naturally. Setup is simple because the frame of the shelter is all one piece and all poles are connected by joints. First I unfolded the legs and spread them outward. If there isn’t any fabric wrapped around the legs, they fall open by themselves. But, I had to move some fabric aside to allow two of the legs to fully extend. Next, I grabbed the frame hub at the center of the ceiling of the canopy and raised it above my head. The last step was to pull a drawstring down through the center of the hub, which caused all of the poles to expand outwards, erecting the shelter. The process was much easier than setting up an aluminum frame pop-up canopy. It took me about a minute and can be easily accomplished by a single person. The shelter ships assembled, so it is ready to take to the beach as soon as it comes out of the box. The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is the only shelter that I have seen with the easy setup pull cord frame that provides complete overhead shelter. I feel that this feature sets it apart from the competition and is a big reason to why I think it’s one of the best beach tents on the market.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4\">\n            <img src=\"/img/pb-setup-1.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Pacific Breeze Sand and Surf Shelter setup step 1\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4\">\n            <img src=\"/img/pb-setup-2.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Pacific Breeze Sand and Surf Shelter setup step 2\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-4\">\n            <img src=\"/img/pb-setup-3.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Pacific Breeze Sand and Surf Shelter setup step 3\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h4>On the Beach</h4>\n\n<p>The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is the perfect size for beach use. Traditional pop-up canopy tents occupy 100 square feet of beach, which is sometimes difficult to find on a crowded beach. Pacific Breeze’s product covers a 95 x 95 inch square footprint, which is large enough to lay under but not so large that it will be occupying excess beach real estate. When it is set up it provides 59 inches of overhead clearance, which is plenty of room to sit under or for a child to stand under. The canopy has an attractive design. The fabric connects to the external frame with plastic hooks, giving the tent a modern feel. External frames are beneficial because they are easy to separate from the tent fabric for cleaning. The polyester fabric is a pleasant shade of blue and is water resistant, and more importantly, ultraviolet radiation resistant. The fabric is rated UPF 50 which means that it will block at least 98% of ultraviolet rays. Beach-goers rely on sun shelters to protect them and their loved ones from damaging rays from the sun, so I place high value in a high UPF rating like this product has.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n            <img src=\"/img/pb-beach-tent.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Pacific Breeze Sand and Surf Shelter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The unique design characteristic that appeals to me and makes this product deserve to be on list of best beach shelters, is the fact that it provides full overhead coverage. In order to be classified as a beach tent, the shelter must be portable and convenient. Usually canopies that provide full overhead coverage are too heavy and too difficult to set up to be classified as beach tents. The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is the only product that I have seen that is portable and easy enough to set up to fall into this category, while still being able to provide full overhead coverage. The canopy has a permanently attached waterproof floor that provides a barrier from the sand. There is a zipper that runs along the edge of the floor, allowing users to unzip and roll the floor back if they prefer to lay in the sand. One of the four sides of the shelter has a permanent wall and there is a second removable wall included. This allows the shelter to be configured to block the sun from two sides. Because the second wall is removable, it can be rotated and continue to provide protection as the sun shifts in the sky. The shelter has a pocket on one of the walls which is ideal for storing valuables that need to be protected from the sand, such as cell phones.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n            <img src=\"/img/pb-interior.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Pacific Breeze Sand and Surf Shelter interior\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h4>Tear Down</h4>\n\n<p>Teardown is also easy. There are two poles that connect to the top central frame hub that have labels that say “push down”. Whenever I pushed these poles down, the hub loosened and the entire frame collapsed. Once the frame was collapsed, I folded the legs inward and aligned them with the rest of the frame which condensed into a single column. When all of the legs were collapsed I rolled up the excess material and secured the bundle by tieing the included polyester cord around it. The tear down process only took a minute or two to complete and also only requires a single person.</p>\n\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n\n<p>Overall I think that the Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is the best full overhead coverage beach shelter on the market. Usually overhead canopies are heavy and difficult to transport so they are not suitable for beach use. But Pacific Breeze was able to design a product that provides the benefits of traditional pop-up canopies while still incorporating the innovative features of modern beach tents such as fiberglass poles and easy setup and teardown. The shelter is the perfect size for use on the beach and is intelligently designed to be functional and pragmatic. I like the retractable floor, removable sun wall, and the built in pockets. I appreciate that Pacific Breeze has included stakes that are built for the sand instead of skimping on thin aluminum stakes. I value that the polyester fabric is resistant to water and ultraviolet rays. All in all I think that the Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is a well made beach shelter that deserves to be on the list of best beach tents and is the best option for consumers who are looking for full overhead coverage.</p>','/img/ocean-bliss.png','Review,Beach'),('preventing-canopy-tent-leaks',88,'How to Prevent Water Leaking Into a Canopy Tent','We discuss creative ways to prevent water from leaking through the material of your pop up canopy tent.','Dave Hollander','January 8, 2023','<p>Pop-up canopy tents can offer shelter from sun and wind, and they can also keep you dry on rainy days.</p>\n\n<p>But sometimes water can leak inside a pop-up canopy tent or <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">backpacking tent</a>. If you are tired of water dripping down on you or your stuff inside your tent, there are steps you can take to stop it from happening.</p>\n\n<p>With a high-quality tent, a suitable setup, and the right techniques and treatments, you can ensure that the space underneath your canopy stays nice and dry.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Get the right type of tent to begin with.</h3>\n\n<p>It all starts with picking out a high-quality canopy tent that is intended for use in rainy conditions.</p>\n\n<p>That means getting a tent that is constructed out of a water-resistant <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">material</a> like durable 600 Denier polyester.</p> \n\n<p>Naturally, if you are expecting the breeze to blow any of the rain sideways, you also are going to want to attach sidewalls to your canopy tent.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Set up your tent properly with quality ropes and stakes.</h3>\n\n<p>To prevent your tent from sagging and keep water from pooling, on top, you are going to need to set it up the right way.</p>\n\n<p>That means using long, heavy-duty stakes and strong ropes that really allow you to get the corners tight. Check out <a href=\"https://www.greenbelly.co/pages/how-to-setup-guylines-and-stake-down-a-tent\" target=\"_blank\">this resource</a> to learn how to properly stake down your tent.</p>\n\n<p>Some products come with high-quality ropes and stakes. But if the ropes and stakes that came with your pop-up canopy tent are a bit flimsy, you might want to shop for aftermarket alternatives. You will be surprised what a difference it can make.</p>\n\n<p>Are you setting up the pop-up canopy tent for long-term use in one spot? If you are not going to be taking it down anytime soon, you should rope to the frame itself, not the eyelets on the covers.</p> \n\n<h3>3. Try using pool noodles or hula hoops.</h3>\n\n<p>If the problems with pooling and dripping continue even after setting up a quality waterproof tent the right way, there are a couple of tricks you can try.</p>\n\n<p>The first is to shove pool noodles into the corners. What this will do is add tension to the canopy. Water is then less likely to pool on top of the tent.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of different techniques you can use with the pool noodles. So, you may need to experiment a bit to find out what works best with your particular model of canopy tent.</p>\n\n<p>Does your tent have a cross-braced truss system? If so, you can use hula hoops instead of pool noodles to achieve the same thing. You will need to attach the hula hoops with duct tape.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Patch up any holes or tears you find.</h3>\n\n<p>While the tips above can prevent pooling and leaking in your canopy tent, they will not be sufficient to stop water getting inside if you have any kind of hole or tear.</p>\n\n<p>In that situation, you will need to pick up a patch repair kit (one may have come with your tent; if not, you will have to buy it separately).</p>\n\n<p>We suggest that you apply patches to the tent material on both sides.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Apply sealants.</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, there are some products you can apply to your tent to further enhance its water-resistance. Among those products are sealants and water-repelling sprays.</p>\n\n<p>If you purchased a tent that was marketed as waterproof or water-resistant, it presumably has a polyurethane coating. Over time, that coating can wear down, allowing water to soak through the fabric and start dripping inside your tent.</p>\n\n<p>This does not happen in a uniform way; you will probably notice there are certain spots where the coating is especially compromised. What you can do is apply the sealant directly to those areas. Make sure the sealant has time to dry completely before it is exposed to more water. Otherwise, it will just wash away.</p>\n\n<p>If it is the seams of your canopy tent that are leaking, you can use the same solution. Just apply seam sealant to the spots where you see the old sealant degrading.</p>\n\n<p>What if your seams are completely unsealed to begin with? It is up to you whether you want to try applying sealant to them or not. If they are not leaking, you can just leave them alone. But if they are—or if you just want to take extra precautions—you can go ahead and seal them.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Apply a water-repelling spray.</h3>\n\n<p>Along with sealants, water-repelling sprays are also available to enhance the water-resistance of your pop-up canopy tent.</p>\n\n<p>Water-repelling sprays are fast and easy to apply to large surface areas, making them ideal for covering all of your tent fabric.</p>\n\n<p>Once the spray is applied and has a chance to dry, it will help water to bead and drip rather than penetrating the fabric to the interior.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Don’t forget about the entrance to the tent.</h3>\n\n<p>Even when you have sidewalls set up, your tent is still going to have an opening serving as a door. Rain may be able to get in through this opening.</p>\n\n<p>What you can do about that is hang a shower curtain or curtain liner in the opening. This will keep the water out, but still make it easy for you or other people to come and go from the pop-up canopy tent.</p>\n\n<h2>Stay Dry Underneath Your Canopy Tent</h2>\n\n<p>If your canopy tent leaks, there is a good chance you either do not have a well-constructed, water-resistant tent to begin with, have not set up your tent effectively, or you need to take some additional steps to enhance its waterproofing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/\">Quality pop-up canopy tents</a> can do an excellent job keeping out water once you have adequately patched, sealed and sprayed their fabric and tightened their corners with heavy-duty stakes and ropes, pool tubes and hula hoops.</p>\n\n<p>Give the tips and recommendations in this post a try. After you do, you may be surprised by just what a great job your canopy tent does keeping you dry on rainy days.</p>','/img/water-on-fabric.jpg','Misc'),('quick-gazebo-guide',18,'Quick gazebo buying guide','A quick reference guide for gazebo variations and characteristics.','Mark Yates','March 11, 2018','<p>There are several different types of portable gazebos for sale, all characterized by a wide range of styles, materials, and uses. Have you been looking for gazebo kits or quality custom canopies? If that\'s the case, then you\'ve probably found out that it\'s quite hard to decide on which one to get. In order for you to make the right purchasing decision, keep on reading as we\'ve put together a list of the different kinds of gazebos that are available for different functions, as well as a list of qualities to look for to help you identify which might be the <a href=\"/best-pop-up-gazebo\">best pop up gazebo</a> for you.</p>\n<h4>Wedding Gazebos</h4>\n<p>Wedding gazebos are all the rave right now for budget wedding planning. This gazebo canopy brings a magical charm, regardless of the area where it is set up. These shelters typically come equipped with an awning material that runs down the corners and eaves to hide the locking mechanisms of the upper canopy and legs to provide a clean aesthetic. Most come in solid colors, and we found all-white or navy blue to be a favorite among wedding planners to help set the wedding mood.\nOne of these excellent products makes a perfect backdrop for young lovers who are exchanging vows. That includes photographs which will preserve the wonderful memory of the couple\'s day forever, or for your guests to enjoy hors d\'oeuvres and cocktails out of the sun.</p>\n<h4>Sporting Event/Tailgate Portable Gazebo Canopy</h4>\n<p>If you’ve ever been to a child’s soccer tournament or a college football tailgate, you might have noticed the abundance of canopy gazebo tents. This is because they serve the purpose of sun protection better than any other shelter available today. Umbrellas are often too small or need held all day, but a gazebo canopy can be setup and left up all day to enjoy the shade.</p>\n<h4>Hot Tub Gazebos</h4>\n<p>Ah, the magnificent hot tub gazebo. Soaking in a hot tub is one of our favorite things to do year-round, especially in the fall and winter months. To add a bit of flair to your patio hot tub, consider purchasing a small gazebo canopy to put over it. A hot tub gazebo is usually equipped with a flat wall, as well as an oval or rounded wall on one side, allowing you to have a decorative opening and a chance to push your tub against a contour surface without ruining it. They are often much smaller than the typical 10x10 canopy, perhaps somewhere in the 8x8 or even 6x6 dimensional footprint range. Throw up some lights on the perimeter trusses of the shelter to create an intimate ambiance. \nJust imagine kicking back and finally spending time with your husband or wife with a glass of Cab Sav in your hand, the cool breeze that\'s blowing, and soaking in warm, soothing water – isn\'t it lovely?</p>\n<h4>Pergola Gazebo</h4>\n<p>Another type that most people don\'t realize is available is the pergola. A pergola is something like a passageway of sturdy pillars that stretches over a brick-lined patio or decorative garden walkway. At the top, the ceiling is framed using an open lattice. Many landscapers grow climbing vines on the lattice. This results to a dynamic and enchanting garden shelter. You can also use a pergola as a beautiful passageway that leads to a building. The downside to a pergola is the lack of portability as they are often too heavy to move once they are in position. However, they provide a great addition to any garden, patio, or backyard pool area and are very affordable.</p>\n<p>As you know by now, there are different types of gazebos available. There\'s so much to know about gazebos that we haven’t even touched the subject of materials yet.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of all the things that your pop up gazebo should offer. Keep the features in mind as they will help you identify the best gazebo canopy in your preferred variation.</p>\n<h4>Durability</h4>\n<p>Do you want a pop up gazebo that can withstand anything that\'s thrown at it? Maybe a sudden downpour from a red wine spill? If your answer is yes, then look for a pop up gazebo that is made of fabric that can be cleaned and wiped easily. Also, make sure that the seams are sealed well. This won\'t just protect you from spillages inside the canopy, but it\'ll also protect you from unexpected rain. Fabrics are often coated in PVC for this purpose.</p>\n<p>It would be helpful if the pop up gazebo is weighted, which is usually at the base, in order to protect it from strong winds. If you\'re anticipating rough weather, you\'ll have to tie the entire structure down, meaning the gazebo has to be pinned to the ground just like a tent. Even so, you need soft ground as you\'ll be hammering pegs.</p>\n<h4>Safety</h4>\n<p>Safety is among the key factors that you need to consider when purchasing a pop up gazebo or marquee. You can check whether the materials of the product are fire-rated, so you know if you can <a href=\"/blog/grilling-under-canopy\">cook</a> inside it.</p>\n<p>In addition, the structure must also be sound and lightweight enough in order for you to avoid injury if an unfortunate accident happens. What most users do before they buy a pop up gazebo is contact the customer service department of a company that produces gazebos to know whether a certain product passes relevant standards set by the country\'s authorities.</p>\n<h4>Versatility</h4>\n<p>Gardens come in every size and shape there is, which means you\'ll need a flexible pop up gazebo. The best type of gazebo is the one that has detachable panels on every side, so you can choose the location of the access points.\nIf you need to cover a large area, sit several pop up gazebos next to each other. Most people stick to the standard sizes as they are easier to pair up. Canopies with straight legs will align directly next to one another with no gaps in coverage.</p>\n<h4>Ease of Use</h4>\n<p>Last but not the least, an ideal gazebo is one that is easy to use. Check the fastenings. You would want them to easily open and close. Zips or Velcro are some of the best options. Also, the zips must be hard wearing as they might be subjected to heavy load.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus: although this is not necessary, some of the best pop up gazebos come with wheeled carry cases.</p>\n','/img/market-gazebos.jpg','Misc'),('rain-camping-checklist',28,'Camping in Rain Checklist','From waterproof tents to extra clothes, we identify the tips and essentials to make the most out of camping in the rain.','Jack Manning','Nov 19, 2018','<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget my first camping trip in the rain&mdash;largely because it was unintentional and I was woefully under-prepared. The spring flowers were in bloom, and the valley I had hiked to was absolutely stunning.</p>\n<p>But you know the saying about &ldquo;April showers bring May flowers.&rdquo; Well, in this case, I got both the flowers and the showers&mdash;and a pretty steady downpour to boot. I ended up getting so soaked that I only got a few hours of sleep that night, and had to head home early.</p>\n<p>But you know what? I had the campsite to myself, which wouldn&rsquo;t have happened during peak season. Camping in the rain can be an amazing experience of natural beauty and solitude&mdash;if you do it right. I have found that Spring and <a href=\"/blog/autumn-camping-survival-guide\">Fall seasons</a> are my favorite times to go camping. With mild temperatures and less insects to battle with, I am willing to take my chances with a little bit of rain over hot and humid summer conditions. I don\'t often go <a href=\"/blog/winter-camping-guide\">camping in the winter</a>, but if you are planning a trip check out our recent blog post for a guide to make your excursion a successful one.</p>\n<p>So the next time I went camping in Spring, I went fully prepared for the rain. It was well worth it. Since then, I&rsquo;ve hike and camped in the rain on numerous occasions, and I&rsquo;ve managed to stay warm, dry (more or less), and comfortable.</p>\n<p>To help you prepare for camping in the rain, I&rsquo;ve put together a guide with a <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/skills/cold-weather-camping-sleep-better-than-a-hibernating-bear\" target=\"blank_\">list of essential gear</a>. If you have these items with you, you too can enjoy every moment of your adventure!</p>\n<h4>Waterproof Attire</h4>\n<p>First up, you are going to need a coat or jacket which is waterproof. You also should shop for water-resistant trousers. You will want a hat to keep your head dry and warm (you can lose a lot of heat through your head). Also vital is a pair of waterproof boots. I suggest testing them out at home before heading out on the trails. Make sure that you can tramp through puddles without the water leaking in.</p>\n<h4>Extra Clothing</h4>\n<p>Switch out your cotton hiking clothes for synthetic materials. These take longer to soak through and dry more rapidly. Also pack some duplicates. If you think you\'ll need two shirts, pack four. If you think you\'ll need three pairs of socks, consider packing four or five or even six.</p>\n<p>No matter what you do to try and stay dry beneath your outerwear, it is almost a guarantee that at least some of your clothing is going to get wet. You will need something warm and dry to put on when that happens.</p>\n<h4>Waterproof Tent</h4>\n<p>You will need to pack the right type of tent. The <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">best waterproof&nbsp;camping tent</a>&nbsp;will not only be made out of a moisture repelling material, but it will also have high-quality seams and great ventilation. The reason the ventilation is critical is that without it, the inside walls of your tent will develop condensation.</p>\n<p>Other great features to look for in a camping tent for rain include storage pockets off the ground, a bathtub floor and a vestibule. The shape of your tent should make it easy for rainfall to roll off the top. A dome is ideal, but an A-frame is also worth considering.</p>\n<p>If you pick a high-quality tent and you set it up in the right location, you should be able to spend a relaxing night in the wilderness. The sound of the raindrops on the roof of your tent can be soothing and restful as you drift off to sleep.</p>\n<h4>Tarp</h4>\n<p>A tarp is an all-around useful supply. If you have a large one, you can feasibly cover your tent with it. It could also be used to cover supplies outside of your tent. Another use is on the ground you will be sleeping on. If you do this, make sure that the entire tarp is contained within the tent. If the edges are sticking out, they can wick moisture inside.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/rain-tarp-shelter.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Makeshift rain shelter from tarp\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h4>Waterproof Packs or Trash Bags</h4>\n<p>If you will be doing a lot of camping in the rain, you may want to invest in some waterproof bags or packs which are designed specifically for hiking, kayaking and camping. If you prefer to save money, you can simply line the inside of a regular pack with a trash bag, and then put your supplies inside.</p>\n<h4>Fire Starters</h4>\n<p>It can be a challenge to get a fire going in the rain (in some cases, it may not even be realistic). So make sure that you pack some fire starters to make the job easier. One of the cheapest and easiest ways you can do this is by packing some cotton balls and petroleum jelly. Just apply petroleum jelly to your cotton balls, and they should work effectively.</p>\n<h4>Ready-to-Eat Meals</h4>\n<p>You may not want to count on being able to start a fire at all. Just to be on the safe side, make sure that at least some of the food which you pack can be eaten without being cooked first. Foods that don\'t require refridgeration and have a long shelf life are ideal.</p>\n<h4>Waterproof Spray</h4>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, invest in some waterproof spray. You can apply this to your clothing, boots, jacket, hat, pack, and even your tent.</p>\n<h4>Entertainment</h4>\n<p>Last, but not least, what are you going to do all day if you are stuck in your tent in a severe downpour? You may not feel like venturing out to explore, so you should bring some items with you to keep you entertained while you wait for the weather to turn around. Is it the perfect time to catch up on a book, write in a journal, or so on.</p>','/img/rain-shelter.jpg','Camping'),('rain-camping-without-waterproof-tent',32,'Tips for Camping in the Rain when you don\'t have a Waterproof Tent','Sometimes you just don\'t have access to a waterproof tent. Don\'t let that keep you indoors.','Katie Pezzi','January 27, 2019','<p>When you head out on a camping trip, you have plans to stay comfortable, warm, and dry through the night. But nature has plans of its own. That means that even if you schedule your trip with care, you might get caught in the rain.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the choice, you should always bring the <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">best waterproof tent</a> with you. But, if you don’t have a waterproof tent, that can pose some challenges. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t take steps to stay relatively dry. Below are some tips to help you enjoy your trip in as much comfort as possible.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><h5>Make sure that you are camping on high ground with good run-off.</h5>\n\n<p>If there is any chance of precipitation at all when you are camping, you would do best to avoid pitching your tent in a low-lying area where run-off can gather. Instead, head to the high ground.</p> \n\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/high-ground.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"High Ground on rainy day\">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n\n<p>What if you are stuck camping in a valley? You can still check the level of the ground and try and pick a spot where the ground should carry run-off away from your tent. You can also try and avoid spots with overly soft soil which may absorb all the water and turn into mud. Try to identify the high water mark if there is a river or lake nearby, and ensure that your tent is pitched above it.</p></li>\n\n<li><h5>Bring along a couple of tarps (at least).</h5>\n\n<p>It is smart to bring 2-4 tarps with you when you go camping. Set them up as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first tarp should go underneath your tent. But here’s the thing—you should put it down inside the tent only. A lot of folks put down the tarp, and then erect the tent on top of it with the edges of the tarp protruding beyond the sides of the tent. This seems like a logical move, but it isn’t. The problem with doing it this way is that it wicks moisture right into your sleeping area. Don’t let that happen. </li>\n\n<li>You can set up another tarp above your tent as well. You may want to do this before you set up your tent in order to keep the area dry as you are doing so. After you get your tent set up, leave this tarp in place. It not only can continue to protect your tent, but it also gives you a sheltered space where you can change out of wet clothing before going into your tent so that you do not bring water inside with you.</li>\n\n<li>A third tarp can be used to create an awning over your camp area where you have stowed additional gear, cooking supplies, etc.</li>  \n\n<li>If there is a lot of wind blowing in rain from the sides, consider a fourth tarp to place directly over top of any supplies you are keeping outside your tent. You may want to tie this tarp down or secure it somehow (i.e. with some heavy rocks).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tarps are lightweight and easy to fold up and carry, and they can make a huge difference in your camping experience in the rain, so don’t neglect them.</p></li>\n\n<li><h5>Use waterproof bags or trash bags for your camping gear.</h5>\n \n <p>Even if you do not have a waterproof tent, you hopefully have some other <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/blog/camp/12-tips-camping-rain\" target=\"_blank\">waterproof supplies for camping</a> such as waterproof backs and bags. Don’t have these either? There is a simple solution. Just grab some trash bags and stuff those inside whatever packs you do have in order to give them a waterproof internal lining.</p></li> \n\n<li><h5>Coat your tent and other supplies with waterproof spray.</h5>\n\n<p>Another step that you can take to protect your tent from moisture is to purchase some waterproof spray. Apply this to your tent after you set it up, and use it on any other items that you want to provide with an extra layer of protection.</p></li>\n\n<li><h5>Don’t forget other essentials for camping in the rain.</h5> \n\n<p>Tarps, trash bags, and waterproof spray can go a long way toward keeping your campsite dry and comfortable. But they are not all that you need to <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/skills/how-to-stay-dry-at-camp\" target=\"_blank\">camp effectively in the rain</a>. Here are some additional items to bring with you on your trip:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Waterproof clothes and footwear. These supplies are self-explanatory.</li>\n\n<li>Warm synthetic attire. Cotton is something you want to avoid in the rain as it soaks quickly and takes ages to dry. Take extra layers with you, and double up on your packing. Assume that your clothes are going to get wet and that you will need something dry to change into.</li>\n\n<li>Repair supplies if your tarp gets ripped. Repair tape designed for RV awnings works. A single leak can give you a lot of unnecessary grief, so you’ll be glad you packed this.</li>\n\n<li>Zip-lock bags. If you are relying on trash bags to keep the stuff in your pack dry, put electronics and other valuables inside zip-lock bags. That way you can be extra sure that they will stay safe and dry.</li>\n\n<li>Fire starters. Getting a fire going in the rain can be very difficult, even if you have shelter. You probably won’t have much in the way of dry kindling to work with. So bring some fire starters with you, like cotton balls with petroleum jelly.</li>\n\n<li>Ready-to-Eat Meals. Trying to start a fire in the rain can be a real hassle when you’re hungry and tired. Sometimes it’s also not possible. Make sure you have something to eat that you don’t need to cook.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Even Without a Waterproof Tent, You Can Enjoy Camping in the Rain</p>\n\n<p>If you do not have a waterproof tent, you can still camp through rain or shine so long as you take the right steps when you are packing for your trip and setting up your campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, a waterproof tent can make life easier. So if you do not have one and you frequently camp in a region which gets a lot of precipitation, you might want to think about upgrading to one when you have a chance. Then you can have an even better experience camping in the rain!</p>','/img/rainy-wilderness.jpg','Camping'),('shibumi-shade-review',78,'Shibumi Shade Review: Is It Worth the Price Tag?','We explore the lightweight beach canopy that\'s powered by the wind to see if its worth its hefty price tag.','Phil Wendie','June 9, 2022','<h2>How Shibumi Shade Started</h2>\n <p>Perhaps more of a sail or awning than a canopy tent, the Shibumi Shade is an innovative take on the beach tent that has caught the attention of vacationers up and down the Carolina. As a result, our team received tons of requests to do an in-depth review of the <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach canopy</a> that blows in the wind to see if it&rsquo;s worth the price tag. In doing so we&rsquo;ll dig into how it works, their patented design, how to set it up, the quality of materials, the fabric stitching, the pros and cons, how it compares to other beach tents, and ultimately if we think it is worth the price tag. But before we get into our review of the Shibumi Shade, let&rsquo;s first learn a bit about the genesis of this beach canopy and the team behind it because we think it&rsquo;s an important part in the success of their growing brand.</p>\n \n \n \n   <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n          <img src=\"/img/shibumi-shade-beach-canopy.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Shibumi Shade Beach Canopy\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n            <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3SqteqX\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/img/amazon-badge.png\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Amazon Badge\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/></a></div>    \n   </div>\n   <br />\n \n <p>The story starts when two brothers, Dane and Scott, and their best friend Alex were on their annual summer vacation in Emerald Isle, North Carolina. This annual trip to the Carolina coast was said to be their favorite week of the year, getting to relax and spend time with family and friends. But their relaxing week was disrupted when they were tasked with carrying umbrellas and heavy canopy tents down to the beach and setting them up every day. They quickly realized 10x10 pop up <a href=\"/\">canopy tents</a> were awkward and heavy to carry while traditional beach umbrellas were flimsy and cheaply made.</p>\n <p>So, they put their heads together to design a lightweight shade canopy to save themselves the hassle of lugging the tents back and forth every day. After a few trips to the local hardware store and the help of YouTube in learning how to sew, the very first Shibumi Shade canopy was born.</p>\n <p>That week at the beach the trio had countless people come up and ask them where they got it. It was that interest which inspired the following year of late nights as they patiently perfected the design into what is today, and a journey of them becoming accidental entrepreneurs.</p>\n <h2>What is Shibumi Shade?</h2>\n <p>The term Shibumi derives from a Japanese Zen concept that is defined as the ability to achieve maximum effect with the minimum means. It was coincidentally the name of the trio&rsquo;s student housing while attending UNC Chapel Hill, the Shibumi Apartments. And so, they thought it was the perfect name for their new minimalistic beach tent design.</p>\n <p>The product is effectively two parts, a 17&rsquo; x 9&rsquo; piece of lightweight polyester fabric and aluminum poles that when connected make a 25&rsquo; long pole that can be formed into an arch when inserted into the sand. The free-flowing polyester sheet is held up entirely by the ocean breeze and is said to &ldquo;work with the wind, not against it&rdquo;, but let&rsquo;s dig into that claim and see if it holds up (literally).</p>\n <h2>Powered by the Wind</h2>\n <p>The tent fabric is made of an exceptionally thin and lightweight polyester which is essential to the free-flowing wind powered design. Their website says that there needs to be at least 3 mph of wind to keep the canopy afloat, and in our research we found this to be accurate as a handful of customers measured wind at 2 mph and reported the sail to collapse and &lsquo;fell asleep&rsquo; at that speed. The good news is that one would be hard pressed to find a beach that does not have 3 mph sustained winds, but it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind. The last thing one would want on a hot beach day with no wind would be no shade, but sadly that might be the case with Shibumi Shade.</p>\n <p>Many have said that during moderate to windy conditions on the beach the polyester flapping in the breeze can be quite loud. Some customers find this to be relaxing and more like white noise, but others have said it is one of the biggest cons of the tent as it can be quite annoying and even obnoxious in gusts greater than 10 mph. Fortunately, the noise is significantly reduced when standing just a few feet away so don&rsquo;t be overly concerned about your neighbors becoming too annoyed.</p>\n <p>If exposed to winds greater than 15-20 mph for prolonged duration, the back seam that flaps in the wind may become damaged and begin to fray over time. Shibumi does offer a free repair kit that should aid in fixing the damage, which a testament to their outlook on exceptional customer service and user experience. We love that the material is manufactured and sewn in the United States, so the quality of the stitching is of much higher than many of their competitors that outsource the manufacturing.</p>\n <p>The polyester fabric has a sun protection rating of 30+ UPF, which is rated to block 97% of the sun&rsquo;s harmful UVB rays. Compare this to the 50+ UPF rating of the lycra/spandex material on the Neso and Sun Ninja tents and you can see there is some room for improvement in UV protection for Shibumi Shade. The 17&rsquo; x 9&rsquo; dimensions of the fabric offer 150 square feet of shade, which is 1/3 more than a traditional 10x10 canopy. We found that you can comfortably fit 4 chairs underneath but could accommodate up to 6 chairs side-by-side if needed.</p>\n <h2>Tent and Pole Frame Dimensions</h2>\n <p>The poles are interconnected with a bungee cord which makes connecting them together quick and easy. After snapping all the connections into place, the pole will measure approximately 25&rsquo; in length. Shibumi recommends arching the poles to an apex of 7&rsquo; in the middle, which will provide the greatest stability for the frame and maximum shade coverage. An apex of 7&rsquo; results in the two ends of the poles measuring approx. 19&rsquo; apart from where they enter the sand, which we think might be difficult to manage at a crowded beach. We think taking up 19&rsquo; of coveted waterfront real estate on the beach might be a big ask, even perhaps an impossible task for many vacationers that like to sit close to the water at popular beaches.</p>\n   <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n          <img src=\"/img/shibumi-shade-patent-10753117.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Shibumi Shade dimensions\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n      </div>\n   </div>  \n   <br />\n <h2>How to Assemble</h2>\n <p>The tent is very easy to set up, and many customers have said that by themselves it takes them between 4-8 minutes to have the tent fully assembled. Start by removing the poles from the carrying bag and connect them together to form the 25&rsquo; long pole. Next, thread the pole through the canopy loop channel until the entire fabric is evenly spaced across the pole. Be extremely careful during this step as the polyester is lightweight and too much force could cause a piece of the fabric to snag on a pole connector and create a small tear. Wrap the elastic bands around the pole three times and snap them into place, keeping them securely fastened and preventing the polyester from sliding on the pole.</p>\n <p>Next, place the poles perpendicular to the direction of the wind so that the canopy sheet can best catch the breeze. Bury one end of the pole 6&rdquo; &ndash; 8&rdquo; into the sand and bend the other end until the center apex of the arch measures approximately 7&rsquo; high. Dig the second end of the pole 6&rdquo; &ndash; 8&rdquo; into the sand. Lastly, fill the carrying bag with sand and position it in the front of the tent and tether it to the apex of the pole which will securely fasten the entire frame and act as a counterweight to prevent swaying during <a href=\"/blog/tips-for-using-your-canopy-tent-in-the-wind\">windy conditions</a>.</p>\n <p>When your beach day is over and you&rsquo;re ready to pack up, you&rsquo;ll need to remove the fabric from the pole. Again, be careful not to use too much force during this step as it could cause nicks and tears in the canopy fabric. This process of threading the fabric through the pole and removing it from the pole during each use will increase the chances of damaging the fabric over time, and at the very least might be a hassle. Many older generation camping tents have replaced threading poles through tent channels with a fully assembled hub system for these very reasons. Of course, with only one pole Shibumi Shade can&rsquo;t accommodate this new design and it is much easier than tents with 8 fiberglass support rods, but improvements in pole design and fabric material will be welcomed over the years to help reduce repetitive snags and tears.</p>\n <h3>Features We Love</h3>\n <p>The design is a fun, innovative, and well-made beach tent that leverages the wind to power the shade, which means it&rsquo;s able to do away with the typical frame needed to support a canopy. The result is a lightweight portable tent that weighs just 4 lbs., allowing even the smallest family member to tote it to the beach. With its minimalistic design it lacks a rigid structure, so it won&rsquo;t fly away in a strong gust or go tumbling down the beach like we&rsquo;ve all seen with 10x10 canopy tents. The tent can be set up by just one person, which is a feature that we always love to see in beach canopies. The 150 sq. ft. of shade is significantly more than what most pop up canopy tents offer. We especially love that all Shibumi Shade products are made in America.</p>\n <p>Overall, we think it has one of the coolest design aesthetics in this space and having one will undoubtedly have people coming up to you asking you what it&rsquo;s called and where you got it. They of course know this, so included in the carrying bag is a handful of business cards for you to hand out when it inevitably happens.</p>\n <h3>Things We Don&apos;t Love</h3>\n <p>In our opinion, there are quite a few cons with the Shibumi Shade tent. First, and most obvious, is that if there is no breeze at all the tent simply doesn&rsquo;t work. While rare, a <a href=\"/blog/best-affordable-tent-for-hot-weather\">hot stagnant day</a> on the beach is when shade is needed most, and we wouldn&rsquo;t want to find ourselves without it on those days. On the flip side, if it is too windy the tent flapping in the wind becomes quite loud and can become annoying after just a few minutes. Additionally, if the wind changes direction you might find yourself frequently having to adjust the legs to keep the sail flapping in the wind. Also, to that effect, because the canopy is subject to the direction of the wind you might find yourself with an obstructed view of the ocean if the breeze is blowing out to sea. Perfect conditions would be sustained winds between 3 &ndash; 10 mph coming off the ocean, but it&rsquo;s not reasonable to always expect those conditions and there will certainly be days that aren&rsquo;t so favorable.</p>\n <p>The polyester <a href=\"/blog/tent-materials\">fabric</a> only offers 30+ UPF compared to 50+ UPF of most other beach tent options. It&rsquo;s designed with an ocean breeze and copious beach sand in mind, and because of that it&rsquo;s not as multipurpose as other tents. It and can&rsquo;t really be used at events like <a href=\"/blog/trade-show-canopy-tent\">street fairs</a>, <a href=\"/blog/best-tailgating-canopy\">tailgates</a>, and kids soccer tournaments. And on a crowded shoreline, it is quite large with its 19&rsquo; width so those that prefer waterfront seating might find it difficult to find the needed space to set up. Lastly, the price is currently $250 on <a href=\"https://shibumishade.com/\">ShibumiShade.com</a> which is almost double every other beach tent on the market.</p>\n <h2>Alternatives</h2>\n <p>If your interest in reading this Shibumi Shade review was due to its lightweight design, but you&rsquo;re turned off due to the high price tag, we want to highlight two beach canopy alternatives that are lightweight and offer many of the same benefits at a much lower price point.</p>\n <h3>Neso Grande and Sun Ninja</h3>\n <p>Neso and Sun Ninja tents were designed as lightweight beach canopy tents able to withstand windy coastal conditions and block the sun&rsquo;s harmful UV rays. Weighing only 7 lbs., each tent uses sand as anchors so you get the rock-solid stability but can leave the weight at the beach when it&rsquo;s time to go home. The 50+ UPF lycra fabric blocks 99% UV rays and is water resistant. And with four lightweight aluminum poles supporting the fabric, the wind (or lack thereof) and its direction won&rsquo;t impact your set up in the least. We absolutely love the <a href=\"/blog/neso-grande-beach-canopy\">Neso</a> and <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy#review42\">Sun Ninja</a> tents, and at the time of writing this they are $90 less than the Shibumi Shade.</p>\n <p><br></p>\n <table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n     <tbody>\n         <tr>\n             <td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\">\n                 <h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Neso Grande</h4>\n             </td>\n             <td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\">\n                 <h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sun Ninja&nbsp;</h4>\n             </td>\n         </tr>\n         <tr>\n             <td style=\"width: 50.0000%;\">\n                 <div data-empty=\"true\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3x4RF4X\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/img/neso-grande-shibumi-shade-alternative.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Grande Beach Shade\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" /></a></div>\n             </td>\n             <td style=\"width: 50.0000%;\">\n                 <div data-empty=\"true\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3m6l1K0\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/img/sun-ninja-shibumi-shade-alternative.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Neso Grande Beach Shade\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" /></a></div>\n             </td>\n         </tr>\n     </tbody>\n </table>\n <p>We hope you found our Shibumi Shade review helpful, if you have any questions or want to your experience with the tent please contact us!</p>','/img/shibumi-hero.jpg','Review,Beach'),('state-parks-pt-1',72,'Our Favorite State Parks: West Coast','Part 1 of our 4 part series detailing our favorite west coast US state parks.','Paul Mooner','January 15, 2022','<div class=\"page-header\">\n<small>Check out all 4 parts of our series on our favorite state parks: <a href=\"/blog/state-parks-pt-1\">Part 1: West Coast</a>, <a href=\"/blog/state-parks-pt-2\">Part 2: Mountain Region</a>, <a href=\"/blog/state-parks-pt-3\">Part 3: Midwest</a> and <a href=\"/blog/state-parks-pt-4\">Part 4: East Coast</a>.</small>\n</div>\n\n<p>Did you know there are more than 10,230 state parks throughout the US? National parks may get most of the attention, but more of these beautiful state parks deserve to be in the spotlight.</p>\n \n <p>Indeed, state parks are often less crowded than national parks, and may cost less to visit and camp at as well.</p>\n \n <p>In this multi-part guide, we are going to share some of our top recommendations with you for state parks to enjoy. Let&apos;s kick off by sharing several of our favorites on the West Coast. We&apos;ll start in Southern California and work our way up to Oregon.</p>\n \n <h3>1. Cuyamaca Rancho State Park</h3>\n \n <p>If you drive east out of San Diego along I-8, and then drive up highway 79, you will reach a special place called <a href=\"https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=667\" target=\"_blank\">Cuyamaca Rancho State Park</a> up in the mountains.</p>\n \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/cuyamaca-rancho-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Trail through Cuyamaca Rancho State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <p>Here, you will find more than 100 miles of trails where you can hike, cycle, or ride on horseback. Explore forests and meadows, stumble upon idyllic creeks, and marvel at the majesty of oak trees. As you discover all that Cuyamaca Rancho State Park has to offer, you will quickly forget that a bustling metropolis is just to the west.</p>\n \n <p>Just to the north of the state park, you can also visit Lake Cuyamaca, which features additional opportunities to fish and hike (don&apos;t miss out on the stone maze). Drive the entire Sunrise Highway loop back to I-8 to find even more trails and views. Particularly dramatic are the vistas of the desert that you can see from Mount Laguna at an elevation of 6,000 feet.</p> \n \n <p>In Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, you can camp at Green Valley or at Paso Picacho, which are located at 4,000 and 5,000 feet respectively. Make sure that on season, you place a reservation.</p> \n \n <h4>Why You&apos;ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Cuyamaca Rancho State Park is an oasis of nature that can restore and renew you if you are living in or visiting Southern California. You&apos;ll get away from traffic jams and concrete, and replace them with breathtaking views and peaceful mountain trails.</p>\n \n <h3>2. Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park</h3>\n    \n <p>Close to the California-Oregon border, you&apos;ll find a small town called Crescent City located on the coast. Literally just outside this city to the east is <a href=\"https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=413\" target=\"_blank\">Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park</a>.</p>\n  \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/jedediah-smith-redwoods.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Redwoods in Jedediah Smith Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <p>If you want to behold the mighty redwood trees in all their towering glory, this is the place to do it. The narrow Howland Hill Road will take you on a journey that is up-close-and-personal, fully immersing you in the splendor of the forest.</p>\n \n <p>Enjoy fishing or kayaking? You will appreciate the access the park offers to the Smith River. As you explore the trails around the park, be on the lookout for giant yellow banana slugs and other critters that call the state park home.</p> \n \n <p>While you are visiting, you will have the opportunity to pitch a tent at the Jedediah Smith Campground. A night in the redwoods is a magical experience you will never forget. Just remember that sites fill up fast months in advance, so call as early as you can to make your reservation.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You&apos;ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The redwoods are some of the most iconic symbols of the state of California, and are the tallest and most majestic trees on the planet. The Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park is easy to access from Crescent City, and offers some of the most dramatic experiences of those trees you are going to find.</p>\n \n <h3>3. Smith Rock State Park</h3>\n \n <p>In recent years, Bend, OR has become one of the country&apos;s outdoor recreational hotspots. If you drive northeast of Bend along highway 97, you will get to a fantastic destination called <a href=\"https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=36\" target=\"_blank\">Smith Rock State Park</a>.</p>\n \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/smith-rock.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Smith Rock Park in winter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <p>Describing the destination, Oregon State Parks writes, &quot;If you enjoy scenic views of deep river canyons or rock climbing, Smith Rock State Park is the place for you. There are several thousand climbs in the park. More than a thousand are bolted routes. We also offer miles of hiking and mountain biking trails. Along your trip through the canyon, you might see golden eagles, prairie falcons, mule deer, river otter and beaver.&quot;</p>\n \n <p>Along with hiking, climbing, and watching wildlife, you can also go fishing in Smith Rock State Park.</p>\n \n <p>This is a wonderfully affordable place to camp, since you only need to pay $8 per night per person. There are no reservations required (nor, in fact, are reservations possible). Be sure to get there early to secure your site since it is first-come, first-serve. You will have access to hot showers and restrooms.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You&apos;ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The rugged terrain at Smith Rock State Park is spectacularly beautiful, and is a veritable playground for anyone who is passionate about rock-climbing. But you do not have to be a climber to enjoy your experience at this state park. You will love the breathtaking scenery, the trails, and the sight of eagles and falcons soaring above.</p>\n \n <h2>Quick Tips to Enjoy Your Stay</h2>\n \n <p>Wherever you choose to set up camp, here are a few tips to get the most out of your state park experience:\n \n <ul>\n <li>Book your reservation months in advance if possible.</li>\n \n <li>Look up amenities provided before you show up so you know what is available on-site and what you need to bring.</li>\n \n <li>Check the rules for the campground, especially around open fires and noise levels.</li>\n \n <li>Have a backup plan. In case of inclement weather, a full first-come, first-serve campsite, or other unexpected issues, it is wise to have a plan B ready in case you cannot camp at your original intended location.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h2>Have Fun Exploring These West Coast State Parks</h2>\n \n <p>Now you have some ideas for where you can set up camp on the west coast. Consider bringing a <a href=\"/\">canopy tent</a> to pop up alongside your camping tent so you have a shaded, sheltered spot to stow gear, sit and relax, or eat.

In <a href=\"/blog/state-parks-pt-1\">Part 1</a> of our series, we shared our favorite state parks with you on the west coast. In this part, we are going to explore some beautiful parks in the mountain region.</p>\n \n <h2>Why We Love State Parks</h2>\n \n <p>National parks are amazing, but they can get crowded—especially during our pandemic times. State parks often are a little more off-the-beaten-track. Plus, fees to enter and camp are sometimes lower.</p>\n \n <p>Let’s go ahead and dive into our list!</p>\n \n <h3>1. Valley of Fire State Park</h3>\n \n <p>While you are driving on I-15 between Las Vegas, NV and St. George, UT, you will come across the <a href=\"http://parks.nv.gov/parks/valley-of-fire\" target=\"_blank\">Valley of Fire State Park</a> in Nevada. Founded in 1935, it is both the state’s oldest state park and its biggest. To get there, you will have to turn off the interstate.</p>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/valley-of-fire-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Valley of Fire State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n <p>This sprawling park comprises 40,000 acres, and features stunning formations of red sandstone. Along with the rock formations, you also will be able to take a look at petrified trees and petroglyphs that are thousands of years old.</p>\n \n <p>For those not camping, the hours are between sunrise and sunset. There is a $10 access fee. Camping costs an additional $20 per vehicle if you are in an RV, or $25 per vehicle if you are not. There are a pair of campgrounds to choose from, with 72 units available between them. There are showers on-site along with water, restrooms, grills, and shade. You can stay for up to 14 days.</p>\n \n <p>Note that Valley of Fire does not accept reservations. So, you will want to get there early to make sure you get a site.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>Valley of Fire features some truly distinctive rock formations. The bright colors of the landscape add to its grandeur, making for dramatic vistas no matter where you look.</p>\n \n <p>While the rock formations will probably capture much of your attention, dotted across the landscape are beautiful creosote bushes and cacti. You may also encounter desert wildlife such as jackrabbits, desert tortoises, and antelope ground squirrels.</p>\n \n <h3>2. Eleven Mile State Park</h3>\n \n <p>If you drive west out of Colorado Springs and continue on past Pikes Peak, you eventually will come to <a href=\"https://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/ElevenMile\" target=\"_blank\">Eleven Mile State Park</a>. In fact, exactly 11 miles to the north is Lake George.</p>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/11-mile-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Eleven Mile State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n <p>The park features 7,662 acres of land, and provides access to the Eleven Mile Reservoir. If you are looking for wide open spaces, beautiful views, and water-based activities, you are in the right place.</p>\n \n <p>There are nine campgrounds and several hundred total campsites, so you have plenty options for where to pitch your tent or park your RV. Different sites offer different amenities, so make sure you do your research and pick the one that will be most suitable for you.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>The scenery is just one of the draws to Eleven Mile State Park. The other attraction is the wide range of activities you can enjoy when you are staying here.</p>\n \n <p>You can go hiking, cycling, birding, boating, fishing, cross-country skiing, hunting, ice skating, sailboarding, and more. If you fish, you could catch rainbow trout, brown trout, northern pike and more.</p>\n \n <h3>3. Sinks Canyon State Park</h3>\n \n <p>Close to the middle of Wyoming is a beautiful place to set up camp: <a href=\"https://www.sinkscanyonstatepark.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sinks Canyon State Park</a>. With its location in the Wind River Mountains, its definitive feature is the flow of one fork of the Popo Agie River through its canyon. The river passes into a cavern with the name “the Sinks” along its route.</p>\n \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/sinks-canyon-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Sinks Canyon State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n <p>If you want to camp here, be aware that there is no electricity. Vault toilets, potable water, and firewood are all on-site, however. Your site also will have a table and a firepit. Be aware that you need a reservation to camp in the park.</p>\n \n <h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n \n <p>You will appreciate the picturesque scenery in this state park along with the diversity of its ecology. In fact, you can visit both a pine-fir montane forest zone and a subarid zone while you are here. Some of the animals you may encounter include bull snakes, rattlesnakes, yellow-bellied marmots and mule deer. While visiting the park, you can go cycling, hiking, and more.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Camping at Mountain Region State Parks</h2>\n \n <ul>\n <li><a href=\"/blog/national-park-planning\">Know how</a> booking works. As we discussed, some camping sites take reservations while others are first-come, first-serve. Look up how to book well in advance, and plan accordingly. Remember, state parks are more crowded these days than they were before the pandemic, so you should make reservations early when possible. It is wise to have a backup plan if you are trying to get a spot on a first-come, first-serve basis.</li>\n \n <li>Check the amenities and rules. Because amenities and rules vary from one campsite to the next—even sometimes within the same park—you need to look up both before you pack and plan for your stay.</li> \n \n <li>Layer up. Weather in the mountain states can range widely between day and night. Mountainous areas also often feature dramatically different microclimates. So, it is best to pack layers to wear so you can easily add or remove them during your visit.</li>\n \n <li>Bring a <a href=\"/\">pop-up canopy tent</a>. While you will sleep in a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">camping tent</a> (or your RV or fifth wheel, if you are bringing one), a pop-up canopy tent can be a very useful addition to your site. You can store camping supplies under it to keep them from getting rained on, or you can set up some camp chairs beneath where you can kick back after you return from hiking or other activities.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h2>Enjoy Exploring These Mountain Region State Parks</h2>\n \n <p>Now you have some ideas for where to pitch your tent in some of the most beautiful state parks in the mountain region.

Starved Rock State Park</h2>\n \n <p><a href=\"https://www2.illinois.gov/dnr/Parks/Pages/StarvedRock.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Starved Rock State Park</a> is among the most beloved state parks in the Midwest. Located in the northern part of Illinois, it is a little more than an hour and a half away from downtown Chicago.</p>\n \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/starved-rock-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Starved Rock State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <p>This park features 2,630 acres of stunning natural environments to explore. The dramatic canyons and waterfalls you will find in the park are the result of the Kankakee Torrent, which was a flood that happened more than 14,000 years ago.</p>\n \n <h3>Why You’ll Love It</h3>\n \n <p>Along with more than 13 miles of trails to hike through the canyons, you will be able to enjoy water-based activities like fishing and kayaking. If you happen to be visiting during the winter months, you may spy bald eagles.</p>\n \n <p>As for the scenery, you will love relaxing near shaded pools with beautiful rock walls enclosing you in secluded tranquillity. The sound of delicate waterfalls will serenade you as you lose yourself in the splendor of nature.</p>\n \n <p>Be sure to place reservations in advance, as this is a very popular destination.</p>\n \n <h2>2. Grand Portage State Park</h2>\n \n <p>If you head to the border between Minnesota and Canada, you will discover a majestic place called <a href=\"https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/virtual_tour/grand_portage/dialup.html\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Portage State Park</a>. The dominant feature is the state’s tallest waterfall, cascading 120 feet. In total, there are 278 acres to enjoy.</p>\n \n <h3>Why You’ll Love It</h3>\n \n <p>The main attraction at Grand Portage State Park is of course the falls themselves. But you will also love the trails and boardwalks, one of which is accessible by wheelchair. Indeed, the park is also free, so it boasts a lot from an accessibility standpoint. There are sheltered spots where you can have a picnic lunch.</p>\n \n  <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/grand-portage-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Grand Portage State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <p>Some resources say that you cannot camp at this park, but that is not the case. NPS provides information here on backcountry campsites. So, if your goal is to really get away from it all and enjoy some peace and privacy, this may be the perfect park for you to pitch your tent.</p> \n \n <h2>3. Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park</h2>\n    \n <p>On the south shore of Lake Superior is the biggest state park in Michigan, <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/places/v-centers/porkies\" target=\"_blank\">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park</a>. Comprising an impressive 59,020 acres, this park offers so much to see and do. You can hike, backpack, swim, or head out on a boat on the famous Lake of the Clouds. You also can learn more about the park by taking part in an interpretive program.</p>\n \n <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/porcupine-mountains-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Porcupine Mountains State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n \n <p>We also recommend that you stop at the visitor’s center early in your visit. You’ll find a relief model there that gives you the lay of the land and makes it easy to plan your experience.</p> \n \n <h3>Why You’ll Love It</h3>\n \n <p>At Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, more than 90 miles of trails await you, taking you deep into the old-growth forest. As you explore, you will discover streams, rivers and waterfalls. Be sure to drop by in autumn so you can marvel at the fiery colors of the fall leaves.</p>\n \n <p>Like Grand Portage State Park, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park offers backcountry camping. You will need to grab a permit from the visitor’s center. When you arrive at your campsite, a metal fire ring and a bear pole will be waiting for you.</p>\n \n <h2>Tips for Camping at Midwest Region State Parks</h2>\n \n <p>Here are a few recommendations to help you get the most out of your camping experience at Midwestern state parks.</p>\n \n <ul>\n <li>Check booking requirements. Are spots at the campsites at the park you want to visit first-come, first-served, or do they require a reservation? How quickly does the booking schedule fill up? These are questions you need to ask in advance. That way, you can plan ahead and make your reservations or arrive early as needed to secure your spot.</li>\n \n <li>Have a backup plan. We always suggest that you have a plan B in case you cannot camp for whatever reason (i.e. weather, full campsites, etc.).</li>\n \n <li>Look up amenities. Some campsites at Midwestern state parks may have ample amenities. Others may offer almost nothing. Make sure you know what amenities are ready for you and what you need to provide on your own—especially if you plan to stay in the backcountry.</li>\n \n <li>Take a pop-up <a href=\"/\">canopy tent</a> with you. You will probably be camping in a tent, or maybe in a recreational vehicle. But bringing a canopy tent along can make your experience more enjoyable. You can set up chairs beneath it, and maybe a picnic table. It also is an ideal spot to store extra gear that does not fit in your camping tent.</li>\n \n <li>Be ready for the weather. Midwest weather is notorious for changing in unexpected ways. So, pack layers of clothes, coats, a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">waterproof tent</a>, and other supplies to be prepared for surprises.</li>\n </ul>\n \n <h2>Discover These Midwest State Parks Now</h2>\n \n <p>Excited to check out some of the Midwestern state parks on this list for yourself? Place your reservations early if they are required, and get ready for an amazing camping experience.

This post will introduce you to some beautiful state parks on the East Coast.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Visit a State Park?</h2>\n\n<p>You might be wondering why you should plan a visit specifically to a state park, rather than a national park. Here are a few reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get off the beaten path. You are probably already pretty familiar with national parks in your area. But state parks might bring you to some places you have never been before.</li>\n\n<li>Save money. Entry and use fees can be lower at state parks than they are at national parks on average.</li>\n\n<li>Get away from the crowds. National parks draw bigger crowds than state parks usually do. All parks have been more crowded since the start of the pandemic, so it makes sense to visit state parks right now.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Now let’s check out some top parks to consider!</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Red Top Mountain State Park, GA</h3>\n\n<p>Just a little more than a half hour out of Marietta, GA, you will find <a href=\"https://gastateparks.org/RedTopMountain\" target=\"_blank\">Red Top Mountain State Park</a>. Even with its close proximity to its urban surroundings, Red Top Mountain State Park feels like a serene escape from the hustle and bustle.</p>\n\n <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/red-top-mountain-st-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Red Top Mountain State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<p>While visiting this park, you will notice that the soil has a reddish tint. That is the root of the name &apos;Red Top.&apos; There is a lot of iron in the soil, and historically, it was mined here.</p>\n\n<p>Along with wooded paths to explore, Red Top Mountain offers access to Lake Allatoona, where you can enjoy activities like fishing, swimming and water skiing. If you do not have a boat of your own, there are marinas where you can rent.</p>\n\n<p>Those with an interest in Civil War history will also want to check out Allatoona Pass Battlefield.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>It is hard to beat the convenience of the location if you live in Marietta or Atlanta. Plus, there is a ton to see and do, and generous amenities for camping, picnicking, and events. If you want to camp, make sure to call ahead, as spots fill up fast.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Monadnock State Park, NH</h3>\n\n<p>In the southern part of New Hampshire is <a href=\"https://www.nhstateparks.org/visit/state-parks/monadnock-state-park\" target=\"_blank\">Monadnock State Park</a>, named for Mount Monadnock. As you hike, ski, or snowshoe along these highland trails, you will discover tranquil lakes and majestic views.</p>\n\n <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/monadnock-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Monadnock State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<p>Note that you not only should reserve your campground space in advance, but also entry to the park. The state places a cap on how many people can be here at any given time. If you show up without reserving first, you will only be able to get in if there is still capacity open.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>It is hard to match the picturesque vistas you can take in when you hike high among the boulders. And if you visit the park during fall, you will be able to take in a spectacular display of colorful leaves.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Watkins Glen State Park, NY</h3>\n\n<p>At the south tip of Seneca Lake, NY, one of the Finger Lakes, you can visit <a href=\"https://parks.ny.gov/parks/watkinsglen/maps.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Watkins Glen</a>. This small town is famous for the nearby Watkins Glen International race track as well as Watkins Glen State Park.</p>\n\n <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/watkins-glen-state-park.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Watkins Glen State Park\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n </div>\n <br />\n\n<p>The park features some truly distinctive geological formations. A hike up the gorge is an unforgettable one. Along the trails, you can traverse over 800 stone steps, cross the enchanting Rainbow Bridge, and delight in the charm of 19 waterfalls.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you reserve your campsite well in advance. Even though Watkins Glen is a small town, the Finger Lakes area is a popular tourist destination, drawing people from far and wide to visit.</p>\n\n<h4>Why You’ll Love It</h4>\n\n<p>It is difficult to capture in words just how beautiful and unique this park is. All we can say is that it if you ever visit here, it is a one-of-a-kind experience that will stand out among your memories of all other parks.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, you will also enjoy everything else that Watkins Glen has to offer, especially if you are into auto racing. Incidentally, do not miss out on the amazing Corning Museum of Glass less than half an hour away.</p>\n\n<h2>Tips for Camping at East Coast State Parks</h2>\n\n<p>To close out this post, here are a few recommendations to help you enjoy the best camping experience in any of these state parks.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Check how booking works. Do not assume that a campground is first come, first served. Check if reservations are required or highly recommended.</li>\n\n<li>Plan ahead and have a plan B. East coast state parks can be crowded. Not only do you have tourists to deal with, but also locals from the surrounding areas. Quite a bit of the East Coast is dominated by major metropolitan centers, so even off season you may find parks and campgrounds at capacity. When that happens, have a backup plan ready to go.</li>\n\n<li>Social distancing may be in effect in some of the more crowded parks. Check the park’s website for details and follow the rules.</li>\n\n<li>Find out about amenities. Know what amenities campgrounds offer and which you need to handle on your own.</li>\n\n<li>Pack a pop-up <a href=\"/\">canopy tent</a>. You can use the tent for shade and protection from rain for yourself or your gear. Stacking some of your supplies under the canopy frees up room in your <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">camping tent</a> for more comfortable sleep. A table and a couple of chairs under a canopy tent also can be your own private picnic spot.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Experience These East Coast State Parks</h2>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoyed checking out our top recommended state parks on the East Coast.

While this may seem like a minor difference in structural design, there are a number of pros and cons of both to consider. These mean that the type of tent legs you opt for is actually a key consideration.</p>\n<p>Let&apos;s discuss the differences between these two types of pop up canopy tent legs now so that you can select a tent which will best fit your needs. For a more in-depth look at all of the characteristics that determine <a href=\"/\">which canopy is the best</a>, be sure to check out our <a href=\"/canopy-tent-buying-guide\">canopy tent buying guide!</a></p>\n<h3>Straight Legged Canopy Tents</h3>\n<p>Straight legs on a canopy tent are exactly what they sound like. They are legs which stand vertically at right angles to the ground. These legs are your only option with pole tents, and the most common option with frame tents. But you can choose between slant legs and straight legs for both pyramid and cross-truss pop up canopy tents.</p>\n<h4>Pros of Straight Legs</h4>\n<p>Straight legs provide you with a couple of excellent benefits on a canopy tent:</p>\n<p>The shade from the canopy covers the full square footage between the legs of the tent. This is not the case with slanted legs (you can read about this in detail in the section on canopy tents with slanted legs below).</p>\n<p>Planning on setting up your canopy tent in a crowded venue such as a <a href=\"/blog/farmers-market-tips\">farmers market or craft show</a>? This is easiest to do if you purchase a tent which includes straight legs. You can erect the tent right next to another one without any wasted space in between. In fact, you can even put the tent up right next to a wall if necessary, which can help to provide you with more shade and shelter from wind.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/straight-legged-red-canopy.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Canopy tent at a craft fair\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h4>Cons of Straight Legs</h4>\n<p>Straight legs on a canopy tent do present a few disadvantages as well:</p>\n<p>Because all four legs of the canopy tent are perpendicular to the ground, the tent has a &ldquo;square&rdquo; structure. In engineering, this is not the most stable of structures since it can easily be bent into a rhombus shape. If you picture the tent in your mind&rsquo;s eye and a strong wind pushing at one side of it, it is easy to imagine this deformation taking place. All four legs will angle together toward the opposite side, and the tent could feasibly fall over.</p>\n<p>Thicker tent poles are required to strengthen a canopy tent with straight legs in order to compensate for the structural weakness discussed above. This can make the whole tent bulkier and heavier. If you need to carry the tent around a lot, transporting it could be a more cumbersome prospect as a result of this heftier size and weight.</p>\n<p>The need for thicker poles can also drive up its price. That being said, if the tent provides you with long-term value, paying a little extra for the shape and features you need makes sense.</p>\n<h5>When to Choose a Straight Legged Canopy Tent</h5>\n<p>Given the pros and cons of straight legged pop up canopy tents, these tents are suitable for outdoor festivals, craft shows, markets, conventions and so forth. They make efficient use of space. They are also an excellent choice for social gatherings where you want everybody underneath the canopy tent to be able to enjoy the shade.</p>\n<h3>Slanted Legged Canopy Tents</h3>\n<p>With a set of slanted legs on a canopy tent, the legs are angled slightly outward from the top of the tent to the ground. The principle reason to do this is to boost stability (see below).</p>\n<h4>Pros of Slanted Legs</h4>\n<p>Because the legs of this type of canopy tent are slanted away from each other, there is a more \"triangular\" structure. This form is favored in engineering for its excellent stability. It is a difficult shape to deform, which is why you see it used so often in bridges and other structures where stability is critical for safety.</p>\n<p>Because the structure of the tent is more stable, it is not necessary for the poles to be as heavy or bulky. The result is that the entire tent can be engineered to be more compact and lightweight. This may make it easier to carry to and from a site.</p>\n<p>With these lighter materials, the cost for a canopy tent featuring slanted legs can sometimes be less expensive than what you would pay for a tent with straight legs.</p>\n<h4>Cons of Slanted Legs</h4>\n<p>If you want to set up a tent with slanted legs adjacent to a building or another tent, there will be more open space in between, which can let in unwanted wind or light.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you see a slanted leg tent and a straight legged tent for sale, both of which feature a footprint of 10&rsquo; x 10&rsquo; at the base. With the straight legged tent, you can rest assured that the entirety of that footprint will be beneath the canopy. But with the slant legged tent, the canopy itself will measure less than that 10&rsquo; x 10&rsquo; footprint. This will leave some wasted space at the edges where there is no shade but the tent is still taking up room.</p>\n<h5>When to Choose a Slant Legged Canopy Tent</h5>\n<p>Consider buying a slant legged canopy tent if your goal is to keep stability at a maximum, and you are not as concerned about space efficiency or about having the most lightweight, compact canopy tent. These tents may, for example, be most appropriate in locations which are windy.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Both Straight and Slanted Legs on Canopy Tents are Ideal for Different Needs and Conditions</p>\n<p>You are now familiar with the structural differences as well as the pros and cons between straight and slanted canopy tent legs. To figure out which type of tent is most ideal for your needs, think about how and where you will use your tent and which features matter most to you. There are excellent products in both categories..

Then here are a few ideas on how to go about it, so all of your family have a vacation to remember – for all the right reasons.</p> \n<h4>Plan ahead</h4> \n<p>Plan your next family holiday in good time, so you find the best deals and have everything in place in good time. From booking transport to accommodation, planning ahead – rather than booking at the last minute – will help you find the best holiday, at the right price.</p> \n<h4>What do you want?</h4>\n<p>First and foremost, consider what you want from the holiday, for example, would you rather tread off the beaten track and get away from it all or instead go to a popular tourist destination with lots on hand to amuse the family. Is <a href=\"https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-shore/best-beaches/\" rel=\"nofollow\">relaxing on a beach</a> your aim or do you prefer to keep busy? Consider the ages of your children and what’s likely to appeal to them.</p> \n<h4>What do you need to achieve it?</h4>\n<p>Think about what you require to achieve your dream holiday. Are you looking for a coastal retreat, a country idyll or a city break?  Do you want to go self catering or have everything provided for you in an all-inclusive deal?</p>\n<h4>Price comparison websites</h4>\n<p>Do search the internet and look at price comparison websites to give you an idea of what’s available, but don’t neglect the personal approach either. If there is a particular hotel you’d like to stay in, for example, do contact them directly, to ask what the best deal they can offer you is.</p> \n<h4>Ask the experts</h4>\n<p>Also, pop in to your local independent travel agent to ask their advice, as they’ll be well versed in arranging family holidays just like yours, so you might as well benefit from their experience. They’ll have lots of ideas for destinations and accommodation that will suit a young family, and you can ask their advice for the resorts or hotels that provide the best activities to keep the whole family entertained. A personal service like theirs will ensure everything is in place in good time, putting your mind at rest.</p> \n<h4>Beach holidays outshine all</h4> \n<p>A classic <a href=\"http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/beaches/photos/best-beaches-on-the-east-coast\" rel=\"nofollow\">beach holiday</a> is a great way to keep a young family entertained, with lots of amusements to hand from building sand castles to paddling, rock pooling to bracing walks – most of which won’t incur additional fees, making an economical choice. Take along the <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com/best-beach-tents\">best beach tent</a> you can find, so your family can enjoy the sand and sea all day long.</p>\n<h4>What to take with you?</h4> \n<p>Your choice of location and accommodation will dictate much of what you decide to take with you from clothes to food, beach or rainy day activities. Don’t forget the journey itself and think up ways to keep your young family amused along the way, that way your holiday will be off to a great start.</p>\n<p>So there you have a few ideas on how to plan your next summer holiday for your family – now it’s time to put that plan into action.</p>','/img/blue-beach.jpg','Beach'),('synthetic-fabric',1,'Man made canopy fabric… Is it worth it?','The canopy itself can be composed of one, or more, of a confusing mix of fabrics. We’ll do our best clear things up.','Kenneth Huebsch','February 18, 2017','<p>So far, while testing canopy tents, we have been exposed to cotton, weathershield, polyester, protex, polycotton, weathertec, nylon, outtex, hydrofilm, canvas, and probably a few more that I’ve forgotten. It can become a little overwhelming and makes you ask, which ones are worth the money? </p> <h4> Polyester and Cotton </h4> <p> Most canopies are made out of synthetic fabrics such as polyester or nylon. The fact is that these fabrics are often cheaper which means you can get more bang for your buck. Of course there are exceptions. Advancing technology has allowed scientists to create more lightweight, more durable materials, which companies can use to create more rugged (and expensive) canopy tents. Picture the canopy tents that are constructed at the base camp of Mt. Everest. </p> <h4> Pros: </h4> <p> I would imagine that most of the people visiting our site do not intend to set their canopy up at the base of Mt. Everest, so I am going to limit this review to the more affordable man-made materials, which are nylon and polyester. These fabrics are cheap, lightweight, quick drying, and low maintenance. All of these characteristics make them prime candidates for canopy fabric. </p> <h4> Cons: </h4> <p> Polyester and nylon do have their drawbacks. First of all they are not good insulators and they are also not breathable, which isn’t a big deal if you’re shopping for an open sided canopy tent. Although, the lack of breathability means that you will get some condensation build-up. Nylon and polyester lose their color over time with exposure to the sun. This is a drawback because many people’s sole purpose for purchasing a canopy tent is for shade. If you are one of these people, let me suggest that you purchase a light colored canopy tent because lighter shades are more forgiving to color loss. </p> <h4> Water Resistance </h4> <p> Water resistance and UV resistance are two characteristics of a fabric that are very important. Nylon and polyester are treated with chemical coatings by the manufacturer, which means that their resistance is manufacturer specific and cannot necessarily be determined just by knowing the type of material. The keyword to look for when trying to figure out the grade of water resistance is the “hydrostatic head”. We’ll cover more about the hydrostatic head in another post. </p> <h4> Bottom Line </h4> <p> So given all of this information, I would say that I highly recommend man-made fabrics, more so than natural materials for portable canopy tents. The most important features that we consider when rating a traditional open-air canopy tent are durability, weight, water resistance, and UV resistance. Nylon and polyester are both strong in all of these categories. Be aware that you need to consider hydrostatic head when comparing man made fabrics. But even the cheaper canopy fabrics still outperform most natural materials. I’ll get into natural materials a bit more in a follow up post, though. </p>','/img/water-drops-on-fabric.jpg','Misc'),('tent-materials',35,'A Comprehensive Guide to Tent Materials','We break down the most popular materials used in tents today to help you better understand the pros and cons of each.','Liam Woodward','February 18, 2019','<p>While shopping for a tent, one of the many features you&rsquo;ll need to weigh in making a buying decision is the type of material used in the tent&rsquo;s construction. If you are not familiar with tent materials, this guide will help you to identify the pros, cons, and best uses of different tent fabrics. Let this article serve as a guide for materials to be on the look out for when purchasing a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">waterproof tent</a>.</p>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n          <img src=\"/img/cotton-tent-materials.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Cotton fiber\">\n  	</div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n<h3>Cotton</h3>\n<p>While you won&rsquo;t run into as many cotton tents today as you might have in times past, they are still a great option for those looking to avoid condensation and enjoy great breathability <em>and </em>insulation.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cotton can allow great airflow, which is especially helpful in hot climates.</li>\n<li>The powerful insulation properties of cotton also can keep warmth inside in cold climates.</li>\n<li>Cotton prevents the buildup of condensation, which can remove a lot of hassle from camping experiences.</li>\n<li>Many people enjoy the texture and scent of cotton.</li>\n<li>Cotton tents are usually durable and long-lasting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cotton is pretty heavy, and may not be ideal for carrying long distances.</li>\n<li>A new cotton tent must be &ldquo;weathered&rdquo; before it can be used in the rain (otherwise it will leak).</li>\n<li>A cotton tent will not come cheap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best For: Consider a cotton tent if your primary goal is to prevent condensation and sleep in a tent which remains comfortable in hot or cold weather.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Polyester</h3>\n<p>One of the most common tent <a href=\"https://www.contrado.co.uk/blog/what-is-polyester-a-closer-look-into-this-love-it-or-hate-it-fabric/\" target=\"_blank\">materials available is polyester</a>. This synthetic is quite a bit like nylon (more on nylon in a bit), but it outperforms nylon in terms of durability and lifespan.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>As just mentioned, polyester is rugged and can stand up to a lot of use. Sunlight does not cause the same rapid degradation of polyester as it does with nylon.</li>\n<li>Being lightweight, polyester is easy to transport. It is also easy to collapse into a compact space, which helps both with transportation and storage.</li>\n<li>Mildew is unlikely to be a problem with a polyester tent.</li>\n<li>Polyester is affordable, keeping tent costs down.</li>\n<li>Even though cotton does a better job protecting occupants of a tent from UV rays than polyester, polyester outdoes other synthetic materials in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Polyester doesn&rsquo;t breathe. This can lead to two problems. Firstly, in a hot climate, it can be uncomfortable to sleep inside. Secondly, condensation buildup can be an issue, especially in areas where big temperature swings are common.</li>\n<li>When wind picks up, polyester can make a lot of noise.</li>\n<li>While polyester can outlive nylon, it will not likely outlive cotton.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best For: For a tent which is low-maintenance, lightweight and compact, polyester makes a good choice. You can also consider this as a budget option.</p>\n<h3>Polycotton</h3>\n<p>As you might have guessed, this material is a <a href=\"https://www.fibre2fashion.com/industry-article/5001/cotton-or-poly-cotton-fabric\" target=\"_blank\">blend of polyester and cotton</a>. It was designed as a &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo; fabric for tents.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Polycotton may be heavier than polyester, but it is lighter than cotton.</li>\n<li>Polycotton offers some of the mildew resistance that polyester does.</li>\n<li>Just as cotton provides <a href=\"/blog/finding-the-right-beach-tent\">protection against UV rays</a>, polycotton possesses this property as well.</li>\n<li>Polycotton, like cotton, is quiet in the wind.</li>\n<li>The cotton in the blend makes polycotton more durable than polyester.</li>\n<li>The texture and scent of polycotton are closer to cotton than they are to polyester.</li>\n<li>Excellent breathability and insulation provide further benefits to polycotton.</li>\n<li>Like cotton, polycotton resists condensation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Like cotton, a polycotton blend may be expensive.</li>\n<li>Just as you need to weather cotton before you can use it in the rain, you may need to do the same with polycotton.</li>\n<li>As with cotton, there is more upkeep around maintaining polycotton.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best For: If you cannot decide between cotton and polyester, a polycotton blend is ideal. Even though it shares a few of cotton&rsquo;s drawbacks, it is lighter-weight, and still offers many of the same benefits.</p>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n          <img src=\"/img/nylon-tent-materials.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Nylon fiber\">\n  	</div>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n<h3>Nylon</h3>\n<p>This is another <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">synthetic option for a tent</a>. Nylon tents are popular because they are especially lightweight. They can also be very cost-effective, but this depends largely on what types of coatings are applied.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned, nylon is very light. This has to do with the properties of the fibers. While nylon can form runs (like nylon tights), a &ldquo;rip-stop&rdquo; thread pattern prevents this, but keeps the bulk of the material thin and light.</li>\n<li>Because the material is so thin, nylon tents can also be very compact, which is ideal for storage and transport.</li>\n<li>A wide variety of coatings are available to enhance nylon.</li>\n<li>Nylon is often very cheap.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nylon tents can lose their shape when they are exposed to precipitation.</li>\n<li>Sunlight degrades nylon, shortening its lifespan.</li>\n<li>Some nylon coatings are very expensive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best For: Nylon can be a good option to save money on a lightweight, compact tent.</p>\n<h3>PVC-Coated Cotton</h3>\n<p>One more cotton tent variant to consider is a canvas tent which has been coated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This coating usually is applied to the roof of the tent.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PVC provides excellent waterproofing.</li>\n<li>A PVC coating also can boost the overall strength of the tent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A cotton tent with a PVC coating will be even heavier than a regular non-coated canvas tent.</li>\n<li>PVC (or any other coating) applied to cotton can re-introduce condensation back into the equation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best For: You should think about getting a PVC-coated cotton tent if your <a href=\"/blog/waterproof-tent-features\">main priority is waterproofing</a> and you are not bothered by the extra weight the PVC adds.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Selecting the Right Tent Material Can Help You Enjoy the Ideal Experience</p>\n<p>Everyone has different priorities when shopping for a tent. For some, waterproofing might be most important. Others may be looking primarily for a tent which is lightweight. Still others may be most interested in durability, breathability, or other qualities. Whatever you are in the market for, you now know which materials can best suit your needs.

Attending a craft fair is a significant investment of time and money, and you want it to pay off to the max. Alas, it can be easy for your booth to disappear into the crowd if you do not put extra thought into how to make it stand out.</p>\n<p>A lot of sites offer generic advice like, &#8220;Express your creativity and personality through your displays.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While that isn’t “bad” advice, you can expect that everyone around you will be doing that as well. So while that might make your booth appealing, it will not necessarily make it stand out.</p>\n<p>Following are some specific, concrete ideas for making your booth distinctive and effective at driving sales.</p>\n<h4>1. Set up a canopy tent.</h4>\n<p>One of the first smart things you can do is <a href=\"/blog/how-to-set-up-a-canopy-tent/\">set up a canopy tent</a> over your displays. This will give your booth more height, making it easier to see from a distance.</p>\n<p>A canopy tent also provides shade, which can be inviting on a hot, bright day. Shade has another benefit as well from a visual standpoint. It makes it easier for you to control the lighting of your booth to highlight your product displays (more on that later).</p>\n<p>Is it worth it to set up a canopy tent at an indoor craft show? Actually, this might be extra effective. Other crafters are less likely to follow suit, so the tent can frame your booth and make it stand out even more.</p>\n<h4>2. Create a bold visual theme.</h4>\n<p>Unless your products are themselves large and easy to see from afar, they probably are not going to be what draws attention to your craft fairbooth. Small products are really only visible to those who approach in the first place.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/craft-booth-visual-theme.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Nice visual setup of a craft fair booth\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>That means you are going to need to put some effort into creating a unified visual theme for your entire booth which is itself compelling enough to draw people over to take a look at what you have to offer.</p>\n<p>Come up with a concept which is consistent and which translates effectively into a visual medium. Choose a few colors which coordinate well and provide for interesting contrasts. Think about what would look good on Instagram if you need some direction and inspiration.</p>\n<h4>3. Set up eye-popping signage.</h4>\n<p>Your displays should evoke curiosity, but they should also answer questions. Make it clear with your signage what you sell, and openly advertise discounts and other special promotions.</p>\n<p>Do not treat a sign casually, however. Even though you may think of it as “just some text,” not all text is equal. Carefully plan your phrasing and choose a typeface which is legible and aesthetically appealing. Pick colors for your signage which match the rest of your booth.</p>\n<h4>4. Use solid design principles.</h4>\n<p>Unless you yourself are a graphic artist or work in another design field, you may not know much about the principles of design. You may think of design as something entirely subjective.</p>\n<p>This may tempt you simply to use elements in your booth that you personally find beautiful, without giving thought to whether they are effective from a design standpoint.</p>\n<p>Indeed, design is a subjective art, but it has objective aspects at play. There are patterns to how people tend to perceive visual mediums. If you can master some of these concepts and put them into action, your craft booth will stand out more.</p>\n<h4>5. Direct the eye.</h4>\n<p>One important design principle which you should use when planning your layout for your displays is composition.</p>\n<p>You probably are familiar with some aspects of image composition in painting and photography. But these are also used in retail display windows, and indeed, in craft fair booth design.</p>\n<p>You want to visually frame your displays in a way which draws the eye in, and you want to direct the gaze toward sales as well as specific items using strong compositional lines and flow.</p>\n<p>If this is a topic which is relatively new to you, do some research and look up some examples first.</p>\n<h4>6. Light your booth well.</h4>\n<p>If your booth is wide open to the sun, you probably have little or no control over how it is lit. But if you have a canopy tent over your display, you may have enough shade that you can set up some lighting.</p>\n<p>Like color and compositional lines, lighting helps tell people where to look when visiting your booth. Use several ambient lights to improve visibility in your booth overall, as well as accent lights to highlight specific items.</p>\n<p>Note that there are sometimes specific rules about lighting at various craft shows. Look up those regulations before you select lights for your booth.</p>\n<h4>7. Offer dog treats and dog water bowls.</h4>\n<p>Many people visit craft shows with their pets in town. One easy way you can attract more customers to your craft booth is to put out water bowls for dogs and to offer treats to dog owners. This should get both canine and human attention. More and more people are bringing their pets with them on daily adventures, so it&#8217;s important to offer a <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0317/pages/how-to-be-a-pet-friendly-employer.aspx\">pet friendly environment</a>.</p>\n<h4>8. Check in on social media.</h4>\n<p>Do not forget that there is a virtual world overlaid on top of the physical one in this internet age. The majority of people have their smartphones on them at all times, and that is something to take advantage of at the craft show.</p>\n<p>When you set up your booth, be sure to check in on social media sites like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CanopyTentReviews\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CanopyTent\">Twitter</a>. When customers visit your booth and make a purchase, encourage them to do the same. That way, you can be sure that you are making your booth as visible as possible online as well as off-line.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion: With These Tips on Your Side, You Can Stand Out at the Craft Show</h4>\n<p>You have some concrete suggestions now for how you can make your craft show booth stand out from those around it. Put these ideas into action, and see what happens. Hopefully, traffic around your booth will increase, along with your revenue. Good luck, and may your next craft show be a major success.</p>','/img/craft-fair.jpg','Misc'),('tips-for-using-your-canopy-tent-in-the-wind',51,'Tips for Using Your Canopy Tent in the Wind','Being prepared for windy condition is a must when traveling with a pop up canopy','Jillian Anders','November 21, 2019','<p>If you have purchased a high-quality canopy tent, you do not need to cancel your plans to set it up and enjoy a day under the shade just because of a bit of wind in the forecast.</p>\n<p>It is true that canopy tents are not designed for high wind conditions or particularly severe gusts. But many of them do fine in a mild breeze, and some of the more rugged canopy tents also can stand up to the occasional moderate wind.</p>\n<p>This makes sense, considering how many people set up canopy tents on the beach. Beaches are rarely completely calm. There is usually at least some breeze coming in. Tent manufacturers are aware of this and plan for it.</p>\n<p>But in order to use your tent successfully and comfortably in windy conditions and also maintain it in good condition, you need to make sure that you are following the best practices for <a href=\"/blog/how-to-set-up-a-canopy-tent/\">setting up a canopy tent</a> in the wind.</p>\n<p>The following are some suggestions to help you get the most out of your canopy tent when the breeze is blowing.</p>\n<h3>Choose your site with care</h3>\n<p>The first step to setting up your tent properly on a windy day is to put extra thought into <a href=\"/blog/choosing-beach-canopy-location/\">selecting the right site</a>. Avoid areas where wind is typically funneled, and search for partial shelter if you can find it.</p>\n<p>It is smart to look up information on both how strong the wind will be throughout the day and what direction(s) it is expected from. This will help you determine the best geography for maximizing wind protection throughout the day.</p>\n<p>If, for example, the wind is expected to come from the north for most of the day, situating yourself on the south side of a windbreak of some sort (i.e. a rock wall) can vastly reduce the amount of stress that your tent is subjected to. Plus, it should make for a much more pleasant experience overall.</p>\n<h3>Open the vents</h3>\n<p>Your tent probably includes a few vents built-in. When these are shut, and wind blows in from underneath, it can cause your canopy to billow. This strains the tent fabric and exerts stress on the frame. It can also completely destabilize your tent and may cause it to collapse. When this happens, it can be quite sudden.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n		<img src=\"/img/canopy-tent-vents.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"10x20 canopy tent with open vents\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>By opening the vents, some of that air can escape. This reduces the amount of billowing that the canopy experiences. This can go a long way toward protecting your tent (and increasing your safety).</p>\n<h3>Make sure the joints really are locked and double-check your Velcro</h3>\n<p>When you are erecting your tent, you will need to lock the joints into place. If it is not too noisy because of the wind, you may actually be able to audibly hear when this happens. It produces a clicking sound.</p>\n<p>Double-check to make sure that the joints really are locked before assuming that your tent is stable. Check over your Velcro as well, and consider looking over it periodically throughout the day to make sure it hasn’t been tugged loose.</p>\n<h3>Attach canopy tent weights to the legs</h3>\n<p>You can purchase canopy tent weights as <a href=\"/blog/canopy-tent-accessories/\">optional accessories</a>. For those who will be using their canopy tents in windy locations, investing in these weights is well worth it. They are manufactured by a variety of brands and come in a variety of forms.</p>\n<p>Not only do they literally weigh down your tent legs, but they also increase overall stability. The narrow profile of tent legs doesn’t provide them with a lot of natural stability on their own since there is so little surface area in contact with the ground, but tent weights are wider, and each provides support all around the leg.</p>\n<h3>Make use of anchors</h3>\n<p>Did you know that you can stake anchor posts into the ground around a pop-up tent, just as you can with other types of tents? You run guy lines between your tent and the stakes, and you get another boost in stability.</p>\n<p>If the tent you purchase does not come with guy lines, anchors, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QCJLuC\">tent weights</a>, you should check if the same manufacturer creates compatible accessories that are designed to fit with your tent. If not, you will need to take some measurements and find third-party accessories that can work with your tent.</p>\n<h3>Consider one or more canopy wall panel attachments</h3>\n<p>Although the canopy covering your tent can reduce some of the wind from overhead, all of the wind from the sides will just blow right in since the sides are open. But you do not need to leave them that way.</p>\n<p>There are wall panel attachments that you can purchase and connect to your tent using Velcro. These can shield you from wind blowing in from the sides, making your tent much more comfortable on a breezy day.</p>\n<h3>Know when to take your tent down</h3>\n<p>Finally, it is important to keep in mind that no matter how rugged your canopy tent may be, these types of tents are not designed to hold up to the harshest of weather. Use common sense about when to set up your canopy tent and try to choose days that will only be mildly windy.</p>\n<p>If you find that the winds are more intense than you expected after setting up your tent, keep a close eye on how your tent is weathering the conditions. If you are at all concerned about its stability or the strength of materials, it is better to be safe than sorry. Take your tent down and go without it for the day. All it takes is one really harsh gust to damage your tent permanently.</p>\n<p>With Proper Setup, You Can Enjoy Your Canopy Tent in Mild to Moderate Wind Conditions</p>\n<p>You now have some valuable tips for how you can set up your canopy tent and use it even on a day which is mildly to moderately windy. By following these steps, you’ll protect your investment in your tent and enjoy it to its fullest.</p>','/img/wind-in-grass.jpg','Misc'),('trade-show-canopy-tent',10,'Marketing at your next trade show','Sometimes the canopy tent you use influences what potential customers think of your brand.','Eric Schroeder','September 15, 2017','<p>Every business, charity, organization, fundraiser, radio station, school, police department that holds events indoors or outdoors needs a company branded pop up canopy tent. The reason is simple. Canopy tents are one of the most versatile promotional tool that any organization can own. Often associated with recreational use and beach goers, the commercial use of a canopy tent has increased steadily over the past decade. They are great indoors as convention booths at trade shows and exhibitions, and perfect for outdoor events to protect employees or volunteers from the elements. Completely customizable to fit any business’s needs, instant shelters come in many different shapes, sizes, colors and materials. Marketing and sales team’s love the stylish and practical convenience these canopy tents offer, their affordability, and most of all the durability and portability for repeated use. Most tents are now made of lightweight materials and comprise of a single one piece frame so setup and teardown are hassle free and each pop up tent comes equipped with a carrying bag that will fit into any car and make hustling from one event to the next easier. Marketing and graphics companies have created customizable designs to maximize promotional value across the most visible aspects of the tents, from the valances to half skirts and full side walls. The popular 10 x 10 design gives a professional look while boldly marketing an organization\'s logo and increasing brand awareness to those attending the event.</p>\n \n<p>One of the most important events for lead generation on any sales team is the trade show exhibit. Research suggests that over 75% of attendees at a trade show are a potential customer, which makes them one of the best ways for a company to obtain new leads. Customers approach booths with specific questions in mind ultimately trying to find a business that can help solve their problems. They create an environment that encourages attendee/vendor interaction and fosters a more intimate and personal way to learn exactly how that business can help them. This is the biggest reason sales teams love having a company booth at a trade show. But with sometimes upwards of 1,000 businesses vying for the attention of attendees it can be difficult for your business to stand out. We’re here to show you exactly what to look for to find the best pop up canopy tent for your trade show exhibit and help your business attract customers.</p>\n \n<p>First, the quality of the materials used in the construction of the tent is critical in making a good first impression. What kind of signal would it be sending if one of the telescoping legs were bent or the canopy material is fraying at the seams? A cheap appearance could be very offsetting for a potential customer, showing that if you invest in cheap products it might reflect your brand value as cheap as well. Commercial tents are typically heavier than their recreational counterparts because they are manufactured with a high grade steel frame compared to the typical lightweight aluminum. The second reason for the added weight is that most commercial tents use a full cross truss system. Most recreational tents have perimeter trusses creating a pyramid shape in the canopy, while the cross truss utilizes the mid points on the sides and creates support throughout the center of the canopy. This type of design is intricate and uses more materials, which adds slightly to the weight of the product. Both of these specifications create stability not seen in many recreational tents and will surely add years of life to the tent, making them well worth the investment.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly recommend the traditional 10’ x 10’ size for your promotional canopy tent for a couple of reasons. Companies often rent floor space at trade shows by the square foot. Even if your company decides to rent a larger space, we have found in very few situations does one need more than 100 sq ft of tent space. If there is ample floor space outside of the tent, place high top tables filled with branded water bottles, pens, and koozies that allow a sales representative to talk more in depth with a potential client, one on one, away from the highly trafficked table under the tent. An overcrowded exhibit can inhibit attendees from stopping to talk to your sales team. Remember, the pop up canopy tent serves as a promotional tool first. Just the presence of it provides people passing by a quick glimpse at your company logo and raise brand awareness.</p>\n \n<p>For the promotional canopy tent, it’s all about the graphics. There are a ton of options and places to put your company logo, but you don’t want to overdo it. Having a crowded and busy design can potentially take away from showcasing your exhibit. We recommend having the company logo on all 4 sides of the top canopy to be visible from anywhere in a 360 degree radius of the booth. On the valence, use a color that contrasts well with the top canopy color to create a nice two tone look. The valance is the perfect place to put the company website and Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat or Instagram handles. One of the most effective add-ons to the canopy tent is a backwall with customized graphics tailored to your company’s mission. It stops attendees from seeing through your exhibit and keeps them engaged with your booth during a conversation. Because it is directly at eye level it tends to be very valuable real estate. We recommend using this space to highlight the competitive advantages of your business through infographics. A half sidewall attached to the telescoping legs of the canopy tent can also serve as a great add-on accessory. The top of the sidewall comes about waist high as to not block light or air coming through the tent. And lastly, the table skirt is a must for any table underneath the pop up tent. Match this with the design on the top of the canopy for a uniform look. It serves as yet another place for company branding, but most of all it allows those working the booth to hide belongings and travel materials while maintaining a professional appearance.</p>\n \n<p>For all of these reasons, a canopy tent will serve as the best promotional tool for any business at community events, staff functions, trade shows, or farmers market. Add vibrant graphics and logos to the canopy to really set your company apart from the rest.

But you are not going to want to spend the entire day soaking in those rays; now and again, you are going to want to relax under some shade.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/beach-shade.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Palm Beach Umbrella\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>For that, you are going to want to bring a tent or umbrella with you. Below, you can learn about four different options. We&rsquo;ll go over their pros and cons so that you can figure out which type of tent will best fit your needs for your <a href=\"/blog/summer-beach-vacation\">next beach vacation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Pop Up Canopy Tent</h3>\n<p>A pop up canopy features four legs supporting a canopy overhead. All four sides are open to the air. These types of tents sometimes are set up at parties and other events. As is implied by the name, they can be collapsed for transit and expanded when you are ready to set them up.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach canopy</a>&nbsp;offers some overhead shade while allowing full circulation of air underneath.</li>\n<li>Most pop up canopy tents are compact and lightweight once they are collapsed.</li>\n<li>One person can typically handle the job of setting up the tent or packing it up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Because of the pop up canopy tent&rsquo;s lightweight build, it is not the most stable option in locations with high winds.</li>\n<li>Depending on the angle of the sun, the canopy may provide insufficient shade.</li>\n<li>The canopy does not act as a windbreak at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Best For:</h4>\n<p>Consider a pop up canopy if something lightweight, portable, and easy to set up and take down is important. These are great for parties since the open sides allow people to roam in and out freely. But they may not be the right choice for a windy day.</p>\n<h3>Beach Umbrella</h3>\n<p>This is exactly what you are picturing&mdash;a large umbrella which is designed for beach use. The base of the umbrella typically is outfitted with a corkscrew anchor system. This makes it easy to push into the sand and remain stable.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An umbrella is the essence of simplicity. Almost no effort needs to be taken to set it up or take it down.</li>\n<li>You may be able to adjust the angle of the umbrella throughout the day as the sun moves. Some umbrellas even have special features to make tilting easy.</li>\n<li>A beach umbrella is usually pretty lightweight and easy to carry.</li>\n<li>Airflow underneath an umbrella is excellent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Many beach umbrellas cannot withstand high winds. That being said, there are models which are built specifically to hold up under harsh conditions.</li>\n<li>The amount of shade which an umbrella provides is limited.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Best For:</h4>\n<p>One to two people can make good use of a beach umbrella. For families or groups however, an umbrella may not provide sufficient shade for everyone.</p>\n<h3>Half-Dome Beach Tent</h3>\n<p>This is the most &ldquo;tent-like&rdquo; option out of all of these beach tents. It is fully collapsible for transportation in your vehicle. Once expanded, it has a half-dome shape which offers shade and wind protection overhead, to either side, and behind. The front is left open. This type of tent also may include a floor.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This type of sun shelter can offer you the highest amount of shade.</li>\n<li>If you want to screen out wind, the half-dome shape of the tent does an excellent job. Half-dome tents equipped with guy ropes also tend to be quite sturdy in the face of high winds.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/best-beach-tents\">half-dome beach tent</a> can give you a bit of privacy. If you set it up just right, you may be able to screen other beachgoers out of your view so you are just looking out at the waves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Air circulation in a half-dome tent is lessened, so the rays of the sun hitting the material could result in heat build-up inside.</li>\n<li>You can adjust the angle of this tent, but doing so involves more effort than changing the tilt of an umbrella.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Best For:</h4>\n<p>This type of shelter is ideal for maximizing sun and wind protection while still enjoying a beautiful view. But it is best for one or two people, not for groups.</p>\n<h3>Portable Canopy Sun Shelter</h3>\n<p>This type of tent shares a lot in common with pop-up canopy tents, but it is a less rigid design. It usually is supported by just a couple of poles. These hold up a canopy with ropes at the corners, usually weighted down by sandbags. You can position the ropes as you desire to determine how open or closed the canopy is overhead.</p>\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A portable canopy sun shelter is versatile and adaptable to your needs. As the angle of the sun changes, you can adjust the angle of the canopy to provide more shade.</li>\n<li>Airflow under the tent is great if you keep the canopy high, but if you pull in the ropes to lower the sides more, you can give yourself more of a windscreen.</li>\n<li>People can come and go under the canopy with ease, making it a good option for groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This may not be the most stable type of canopy out there. In the wind, it could conceivably flap around quite a bit, which could be inconvenient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Best For:</h4>\n<p>This type of tent is versatile enough that you can use it for individuals, couples, families, or groups. It can function as an open-air canopy or as something closer to a traditional camping tent depending on how you adjust it. If you want to maximize flexibility, it is an outstanding option.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/beach-vacation.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Umbrellas on the beach\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>With the Right Tent, You Can Enjoy Your Beach Trip to its Fullest</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/blog/beach-good-for-health\">health benefits</a> of a beach vacation are proven.

Let&rsquo;s check out some of the best things to do on your trip!</p>\n<h3>Visit the Oceanfront.</h3>\n<p>The first thing you are going to want to do after you check in at your hotel is head right for the Oceanfront. Here, you can walk along three miles of boardwalk, looking out at the sea. Relax on the sandy beach, take in the sun, or go surfing on the waves.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you are going to be making a day of it, you won&rsquo;t want to get <em>too </em>much sun. Be sure to <a href=\"http://canopytentreviews.com\">bring a canopy tent</a> with you so that you can rest under some shade while still enjoying the views of the ocean and delighting in the fresh sea air.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve head your fill of the sun, surf and sand, stroll along Atlantic Avenue where boutique shopping and vibrant nightlife experiences await. You&rsquo;ll also find plenty of options for delicious seafood and other tasty cuisine. There is often plenty of live entertainment outdoors at the Oceanfront as well. So take advantage of all this iconic part of town has to offer.</p>\n<h3>Stop by Neptune&rsquo;s Park for a show.</h3>\n<p>Speaking of live entertainment, your best bet for finding it along the Oceanfront is to visit <a href=\"https://www.virginia.org/listings/TheArts/NeptunesPark/\" target=\"_blank\">Neptune&rsquo;s Park</a>. Not only can you enjoy a performance at Neptune&rsquo;s Park, but you also can view the city&rsquo;s famous bronze statue of Neptune.</p>\n<h3>Explore the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art.</h3>\n<p>If you are looking to step out of the sun for a little bit, drop by the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA). Exhibits at MOCA frequently change, and feature mainly artists who are living today. Here, you can see everything from painting and sculpture to glasswork and photography.</p>\n<p>There are also a variety of educational programs in which you can participate. Some are geared toward children, while others are aimed at adults or families.</p>\n<h3>View sea life at the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center.</h3>\n<p>This is one of the best-known aquariums you can visit in Virginia. Here, there are hundreds of different species of fish, reptiles, birds and mammals to view. Collectively, the exhibits contain 800,000 gallons of water. Some of the species you can view include loggerhead sea turtles, sandbar sharks, harbor seals, sand tiger sharks, komodo dragons, and more.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center also boasts the claim of having the largest movie screen in the entire state. Other activities include the Adventure Park, boat trips and nature paths. There truly is an adventure for everyone.</p>\n<h3>Virginia Living Museum</h3>\n<p>If you enjoy aquariums, you also won&rsquo;t want to miss out on the Virginia Living Museum. This is actually located over in Newport News, a short drive away from VA Beach.</p>\n<p>This is a smaller set of exhibits than the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center contains, but it is a particularly enjoyable and highly-rated museum experience. More than 250 species of fish, birds, reptiles and animals call the museum home, including injured and orphaned animals.</p>\n<p>Discover the area&rsquo;s history by visiting the <a href=\"https://preservationvirginia.org/historic-sites/cape-henry-lighthouse/\" target=\"_blank\">Cape Henry Lighthouse</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/cape-henry-lighthouse.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Cape Henry Lighthouse, Virginia\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>This famous lighthouse is not only an iconic landmark, but it offers a glimpse into the early history of the US. In fact, it has the distinction of being the nation&rsquo;s first federally funded public works project.</p>\n<p>Take a walking tour in and around the lighthouse to learn about four centuries of history. You can also attend a Dune Talk from a trained interpreter, and stop by the Cape Henry Memorial which commemorates the 1607 landing of the first colonists from England.</p>\n<h3>Tour the USS Wisconsin BB-64.</h3>\n<p>Fascinated by military history? You will definitely want to visit the USS Wisconsin BB-64 while you are in VA Beach. This huge WWII-era vessel is just waiting to be explored. You can either tour it at your own pace, or you can take a formal, guided tour to learn even more about its history.</p>\n<h3>Visit the Military Aviation Museum.</h3>\n<p>If you love planes as much as you do ships, you&rsquo;ll also want to plan a tour of the Military Aviation Museum. This museum houses planes from WWI and WWII. Quite a few of them are so well-preserved that they could still fly today.</p>\n<h3>Escape from the crowds at False Cape State Park.</h3>\n<p>Had enough of the hustle and bustle? Even though the boardwalk along the Oceanfront as well as the many museums, shops, restaurants, and live entertainment venues of Virginia Beach can be a lot of fun, sometimes you need a breather from the crowds.</p>\n<p>To get that breather, just head to False Cape State Park. This rare undeveloped coastal park offers trails for hiking and the opportunity to relax on the beach or pitch a tent to camp. You also can go on a guided kayak trip to learn more about the history and ecology of the park.</p>\n<h3>Relax at Sandbridge.</h3>\n<p>Between Virginia Beach and False Cape State Park, you&rsquo;ll discover <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g58277-d273169-Reviews-Sandbridge_Beach-Virginia_Beach_Virginia.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sandbridge Beach</a>.

In this article, I will introduce you to some of the most important features to look for when you are shopping for a top rated waterproof camping tent. Also make sure to check out our recent post on a <a href=\"/blog/rain-camping-checklist\">rain camping list</a> so you\'re prepared for the worst when it rains.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/after-the-rain-alone-backpack.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Person hiking after rainstorm\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n\n<h3>Waterproof Fabric</h3>\n<p>A number of different materials are used to make the <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">best waterproof and water resistant tents</a>. Some examples of <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">common fabrics</a> include polyester, nylon, poly cotton, or PVC-coated canvas. A polyurethane coating may be applied to some materials.</p>\n<p>It is important while you are shopping to be aware of the difference between the terms &ldquo;waterproof&rdquo; and &ldquo;water-resistant.&rdquo; A tent which is labeled as \"water resistant\" can to some degree keep out moisture. The degree of protection is significantly less than what you get with a \"waterproof\" tent, however.</p>\n<p>Even so, it is also helpful to be aware that no material is 100% waterproof. If conditions are severe enough, water always wins. In regular rainfall conditions however, a waterproof tent should be sufficient to keep you relatively dry.</p>\n<h3>Sealed Seams</h3>\n<p>Pay close attention to this seams of the tent you are thinking of purchasing. Check to find out whether they have been sealed. Seams which have not been sealed may be weak points through which water may enter. Even a tent made out of awesome material will fail to keep you dry if this is the case.</p>\n<h3>Excellent Ventilation</h3>\n<p>While shopping for a waterproof tent, you are probably more preoccupied with keeping things out than letting things in. Nevertheless, it is vital to make sure that there is sufficient airflow in your tent. This reduces the build-up of condensation. If condensation is able to accumulate on the walls, it will drip down, getting you and your supplies wet.</p>\n<h3>Sturdiness</h3>\n<p>Rain is oftentimes accompanied by strong winds. If you are erecting a tent in a storm, you\'re going to want to make sure that it is rugged enough that it is not going to flap around a lot or collapse in on you while you are trying to sleep. This is a matter of not just convenience, but safety as well.</p>\n<h3>Lightweight and Easy to Carry</h3>\n<p>If you are going to be hiking any distance with your tent to find an ideal site to set it up, you should check how heavy the tent is going to be to carry. Also make sure that it can be collapsed and will not be unwieldy. That way, you will not become fatigued before you reach your campsite.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/tent-in-fog.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Tent on foggy, rainy day\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>Fast and Easy to Set Up</h3>\n<p>When you are caught in a downpour, already exhausted from a day of hiking, and there is mud welling up around your boots, the last thing you are going to want to deal with is a complicated set-up procedure to get your tent in order.</p>\n<p>For this reason, I recommend that you pick a tent which has a simple, straightforward, fast setup process which a single person can easily carry out. That way, even if cold rain is pouring down on your head and visibility is low, you will be able to get your tent erected. Then you can get inside and dry off!</p>\n<h3>Bathtub Floor</h3>\n<p>A bathtub floor is simply a floor inside your tent which has low walls around it made of the same material. The idea is that these walls act as waterproof barriers to keep moisture from the ground from seeping in through the walls.</p>\n<h3>Vestibule</h3>\n<p>Tents which include a <a href=\"https://mountainsforeverybody.com/what-is-a-tent-vestibule-for\" target=\"blank_\">vestibule can be great for rain</a>. The vestibule keeps the precipitation off your head, but it is separate from the main part of the tent. You can strip off wet clothes and gear here and change into something dry before you head inside. That way the interior of the tent stays as dry as possible.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the vestibule is also a pleasant spot to just sit and relax and enjoy the fresh air and the scenery. This is true regardless of whether it is raining or not, so it is just a nice feature to have.</p>\n<h3>Pockets for Storage</h3>\n<p>Where are you going to put all of your stuff inside your tent? You could set it on the floor and hope that it all stays dry, but even with great waterproofing, you probably will <em>still </em>get some water on the floor (you could track it in, for example).</p>\n<p>Some of the best waterproof tents include pockets attached to the walls. These can be used to store all kinds of odds and ends. They stay off the floor, which makes it less likely they will get damp. It also gets them out of your way so that you can sleep more comfortably.</p>\n<h3>No Pooling on the Roof</h3>\n<p>Finally, while you are looking at all the details, do not forget about the big picture. Think about the shape of the tent. Does it have a flat roof where water will pool? Or does it have a dome roof or angled sides which will encourage rain to roll down to the ground? If water pools on top of your tent, it could seep through or even cause your tent to cave in on itself.</p>\n<h4>The Right Tent Pitched in the Right Spot Can Keep You Comfortable Even in a Downpour</h4>\n<p>You now are familiar with some of the most important features to consider when selecting the a great waterproof camping tent. Remember that even a high-quality tent will not keep you dry if you pitch it in the wrong place. Try and set it up where rainfall can drain down-slope, not in a low spot which gathers water.</p>\n<p>It takes time and care to <a href=\"/blog/camping-tent-buying-guide\">select the ideal tent</a> and learn how to set it up and where. But that extra time and effort should pay off. When you finally do go camping in the rain, it should be a comfortable and enjoyable experience.</p>','/img/black-and-white-water.jpg','Camping'),('wedding-canopy-tips',21,'Tips for buying and decorating a wedding canopy','A pop up canopy can be a lifesaver at a wedding. Follow some of our decoration tips so it blends in seamlessly.','Jillian Anders','June 29, 2018','<p>Rain or shine, pop up canopy tents are the ideal solution for weddings, as they protect guests, personal belongings, gifts, and furniture from the elements during the festivities. Because there are numerous options from which to choose when selecting a tent of this kind, it may at first seem like a challenging endeavor. Below are some tips to make the selection process a bit less daunting:</p>\n\n<h4>Size and Style</h4>\n\n<p>If you are planning a large gathering with a significant number of tables and chairs, it is essential to select a large canopy with proper ventilation. If you are holding a small or medium-sized gathering at a community park, the beach, or on your own property, a triangular sail canopy or traditional small canopy tent is sufficient. To make the best selection, consider where the tent will be placed and the size of the guest list.</p>\n\n<h4>Frame Material</h4>\n\n<p>Steel or aluminum are typically used to make most canopy tent frames. If portability is an issue, aluminum is a better choice, as it is lightweight. However, it may not stand up against windy conditions as well as steel. If you have concerns about rain or wind on the day of the ceremony, treated steel is the best choice.</p>\n\n<h4>Lightweight VS. Heavy-Duty</h4>\n\n<p>Heavy-duty canopies can stay erect for longer periods of time than their lightweight counterparts, and they can also withstand the elements better. However, lightweight models–those under 40 pounds–fit neatly into the trunks of most motor vehicles and can easily be assembled and disassembled by several adults. The elements, the length of time the tent must stand, and the number of people available to help with the assembly should all be considered when you make this decision.</p>\n\n<h4>Cover Material</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">Cover material</a> is important, regardless of the style tent you choose. Polyester is a popular choice, as it is resistant to water, durable, and usually quite affordable. Polyester with a vinyl coating is a great option if you are looking for material that is both UV resistant and waterproof. However, vinyl coated polyester is quite heavy and this should be taken into consideration when you make your choice. A flame retardant material is necessary if you plan to use the tent near an open fire during the event.</p>\n\n<h4>Assembly and Portability</h4>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/\">best pop up canopy tents</a> often come with simple set up procedures and easy open features. However, you should measure your vehicle to make sure the tent you plan to purchase fits appropriately. Investing in carry bags or roller bags is a good idea if you plan on purchasing a large canopy tent.</p>\n\n<h4>Decorating Your Tent</h4>\n\n<p>Purchasing an appropriate tent is necessary to a successful outdoor wedding, but you must also give thought to how the tent should be decorated. Below are some terrific themes you may wish to consider:</p>\n\n<h4>Whimsical Floral</h4>\n\n<p>Simple floral pieces and lanterns hung inside the tent serve as perfect focal points for an outdoor reception. Strategically place them along each wall of the tent, and hang additional lanterns and floral sprays above the area of the tent you plan to use as a dance floor.</p>\n\n<h4>Natural Glamor</h4>\n\n<p>Lush green garlands are currently one of the hottest trends in outdoor decor, and can be used to great advantage in your reception tent. Use garland to decorate both the inside and outside of the tent, and complete the look with sequined tablecloths and mini string lights.</p>\n\n<h4>Elegant and Rustic</h4>\n\n<p>Pairing lush, healthy peonies from a reliable florist with farm-style tables creates the perfect <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/rusticwedchic/rustic-wedding-decorations/\">combination of rustic and elegant</a>. Add all-natural garlands to this look and you will find yourself in the middle of a dreamy venue that is different from virtually all traditional themes.</p>\n\n<h4>Simple Vineyard</h4>\n\n<p>If you are searching for a less-is-more theme, consider simple vineyard decor. To design this easy look, merely place a no fuss garland at the tent\'s entrance, hang vintage lanterns along the pathways in and around the tent, and spread colorful flower petals down the aisle.</p>\n\n<h4>Decorating With Sequins</h4>\n\n<p>Sequins can be used to create a gorgeous decor without much work. Simply hang a beautiful chandelier in the center of the tent and surround it with whimsical string lights and sequined tablecloths.</p>\n\n<h4>Gold-Pink Paradise</h4>\n\n<p>If you enjoy the glamor of Hollywood, decorate in tones of pink and gold. For example, use elegant, pink-toned glassware, golden chairs, and a subtle, metallic chandelier in the same shades. This look can quickly transform any traditional tent into a glamorous place to celebrate.</p>\n\n<p>It is always best to comparison shop before making a final decision. However, when you follow the aforementioned tips and choose any of the decorating styles listed above, you are guaranteed to be pleased with the outcome of your event.</p>','/img/wedding-sunset.jpg','Wedding'),('weddings-2021',65,'Tips for Getting Ready for Your Wedding in 2021','Demand for wedding resources are at an all time high.

So are many other couples who delayed their weddings in 2020 because of the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You probably have a lot of questions about how coronavirus will impact your wedding in 2021, and what you can do to get ready for your big day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this guide, we will talk about what you need to know as of the time of this writing regarding COVID-19, wedding safety, and wedding planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Impact Will COVID-19 Have On Your 2021 Wedding?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With vaccines rolling out for COVID-19, some pandemic restrictions are being lifted, making this a good year to go ahead with your wedding plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But COVID-19 will still impact your wedding in a few ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Venues and vendors offering wedding services will be extra busy with bookings that were delayed from the year before.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Not everyone is getting vaccinated, so there will still be plenty of people who could get sick at a public event.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The risk for COVID-19 will not drop to zero for anyone.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC has printed some <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> for what you can do after you get vaccinated:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You do not need to wear a mask or stay 6 feet away from other people in most environments. Exceptions are &quot;where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.&quot;</li>\r\n\r\n<li>No testing is necessary for domestic travel in the US, nor is any post-travel quarantining. But masks are still necessary on public transit vehicles like planes.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Requirements may differ for international destinations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, that also tells you what your vaccinated wedding guests are able to do. Keep in mind that your unvaccinated guests should still be subject to greater restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wedding Prep Tips for 2021</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we have provided some context, let’s go over some recommendations for successful wedding planning in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Start planning early, and take advantage of virtual planning tools.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, the sooner you can start prepping for your wedding, the better—you will want to book dates as early as possible and start scheduling with caterers, entertainers, and others who will be participating in the ceremony and reception. Remember, a lot of other couples are going to be trying to schedule their weddings this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news, you can still take virtual tours of venues and take advantage of other online tools, making it faster, easier, and more convenient to plan your wedding than it would have been in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Consider how densely packed you want your guests to be.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Think carefully about how many guests you want to invite. If you always planned a big wedding, you might want to scale back because of the pandemic so that your guests can have more space. Fewer households at your event will also lower overall exposure risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Do you want your guests to have to travel?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people still are not going to feel comfortable being packed in with strangers on a bus or airplane even after being vaccinated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, think about the travel needs of your guests when you are putting your list together and are evaluating possible locations for the wedding. This might not be the best time for a destination wedding. Consider going with a spot that will be local to most of your guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Consider implementing on-site testing for guests.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Strongly encourage your wedding guests to get vaccinated. Make sure you know who will and will not be vaccinated so you can plan seating to minimize risk for all parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on where you plan to hold your wedding and the size of your event, you may or may not need to register negative COVID-19 tests for the guests who will be attending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can even ask your venue if it is possible to conduct on-site testing. Otherwise, you will need to ask your guests to get tested in advance and bring documentation with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Minimize risk with an outdoor venue.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best ways you can protect your guests this year is to hold your wedding and your reception outdoors. This was a trend that started in 2020, and we can expect it to continue for some time to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outdoors, there is ample air circulation and more room for attendees to spread out. Any guests you will have who have not been vaccinated will need to continue to observe the 6 foot social distancing rule. So, you are going to need that extra space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you can do is set up a <a href=\"/best-10x20-pop-up-canopy\">large canopy tent</a>, or several. They can shelter your guests from the sun or light rain, and you can even attach sidewalls to keep out the wind. There are often windows so that you can keep enjoying the picturesque scenery even if you need that extra protection against the elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/blog/fall-wedding\">Artfully decorated</a>, a canopy tent can fit in well with the theme of your wedding. Best of all, you can set one up just about anywhere, which might broaden your selection of possible outdoor venues. That might be a big help if a lot of locations are already booked for the dates you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.  Encourage your guests to mask up.</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\r\n		<img src=\"/img/wedding-masks.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"People wearing masks at a wedding\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, you may want to encourage your guests to wear masks to your wedding, even if they are vaccinated. A person who is vaccinated can still pass the virus to others if they have been exposed. So, wearing masks remains a wise precaution even in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plan and Purchase Supplies Early to Make Your 2021 Wedding a Success</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wraps up our list of recommendations for planning your wedding in 2021. The COVID-19 vaccines mean that you can move forward with your plans, but there are still important safety considerations. So, give yourself extra time to plan your wedding, get an early start, and consider holding your event outdoors with canopy tents to protect yourselves and your guests.</p>','/img/bride-groom-sunset.jpg','Wedding'),('winter-beaches',31,'Best Beach Vacation Spots in the US during the Winter','We explore and highlight some of the best beach locations from coast to coast for your winter vacation','Kye Cardinalis','January 11, 2019','<p><em>Brrrr!</em> Tired of looking outside at the snow?

It is an ideal destination for art lovers.</p>\n<h3>Clearwater, Florida</h3>\n<p>Another destination to add to your winter beach vacation bucket list is Clearwater. This beautiful city puts you within reach of several first-class beaches. At Clearwater Beach, you can swim in warm, shallow water and lounge on dazzling white sand. You also can take a stroll along the Beach Walk Promenade under the palm trees.</p>\n<p>Nearby, you&rsquo;ll find Sand Key. At this park, you can enjoy the convenience of bathhouses, <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach cabanas</a>, a playground and a park where you can walk your dog. Finally, there is Caladesi Island. You can only reach this beach by boat, which means that you can look forward to truly getting away from it all.</p>\n<p>Recommended for: Visit Clearwater if you are in search of beautiful beaches which the whole family will love.</p>\n<h3>South Padre Island, Texas</h3>\n<p>Travel to this barrier island and enjoy 34 miles of beaches. Go surfing, fishing, swimming, or sunbathing, or take a cruise along the coast. Head into town and you will find that there are ample opportunities for shopping, dining, and nightlife.</p>\n<p>The community which makes its home on South Padre Island revolves pretty much exclusively around tourism, so you can be sure that there are plenty of vendors in town to cater to your every need. Many are mobile vendors selling their own personal items from under a <a href=\"/\">pop up canopy</a>.</p>\n <div class=\"row\">\n 	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n 		<img src=\"/img/town-vendors.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Vendors in a beach town\">\n 	</div>\n </div>\n <br />\n<p>Recommended for: Those looking for a resort atmosphere in a secluded location will be thrilled with all that South Padre Island has to offer. Because this is a popular spring break destination for college students, it also is a great place to party.</p>\n<h3>Grand Isle, Louisiana</h3>\n<p>Like South Padre Island, Grand Isle in Louisiana is also a barrier island. The town of Grand Isle is small, but its population swells during peak season (summer). For this reason, it is better to come by during the winter time when you can experience all that the isle has to offer in tranquility and solitude.</p>\n<p>Beaches to enjoy on Grand Isle include the seven-mile Grand Isle Beach, the 230-acre Elmer&rsquo;s Island Wildlife Refuge, and the stunning Grand Isle State Park. At these beaches, you can fish, hike, camp, bird-watch, and more.</p>\n<p>Recommended for: Bird-watching is a very big deal here; there are even trails specifically for spotting warblers, robins, thrush and other species. So this is a wonderful beach destination for nature-lovers to visit. For culinary travelers, Grand Isle also offers a great opportunity to indulge in some delicious authentic Cajun seafood.</p>\n<h3>The Oregon Coastline</h3>\n<p>The beach destinations which we have gone over so far are in warm, sunny climates which remain temperate even during the wintertime. While these beaches tend to be less crowded during the winter than they are during the summer, you might be looking for a little extra seclusion. If that is so, consider a trip to the Oregon coast.</p>\n <div class=\"row\">\n 	<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n 		<img src=\"/img/oregon-beach.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Oregon beach\">\n 	</div>\n </div>\n <br />\n<p>The Oregon coast is not particularly well-known, but it is lined by a series of spectacular sandy beaches and jaw-dropping sea cliffs, with Highway 101 running alongside the water. With majestic sea stacks, powerful surf, and spectacular forest trails, it is a world-class destination that often is virtually empty during the colder part of the year. You will definitely want to bring your camera with you. Breathtaking sunsets are common during the fall and winter months.</p>\n<p>Take note that if you wish to camp while you are visiting the coast, you will need to be very selective about where you do it. You cannot camp within city limits or adjacent to a state park, and you are expected to head to a remote location to pitch your tent. But as that is probably your goal in visiting the Oregon coast for your winter beach vacation, that should work out perfectly.</p>\n<p>Recommended for: If you truly want to escape from the crowds and head to a place where it is just you and nature, the Oregon coastline is a great winter beach destination. You will have your pick of lovely beaches, and should have them more or less to yourself. Just be ready to bundle up against the wind, cold, and rain.</p>\n<p>Any one of these USA winter beach destinations can make for a marvelous holiday. As you can see, the US is home to a number of stunning, inviting beaches, any one of which can make for an amazing winter getaway. Whether you head to a famous sunny spot like Laguna Beach or you pick somewhere colder and more off-the-beaten track like the Oregon coastline, you can look forward to an escape from the ordinary which you will never forget.

If you&rsquo;re unsure of what&rsquo;s required, keep reading our handy guide to learn about the different materials, clothing, and winter camping gear that will make your adventure a success.</p>\n<h3>Prepare For Your Climate</h3>\n<p>Always have a good understanding of the camping area&rsquo;s average weather conditions, whether you are <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/trips/the-colorado-trail-hiking-guide\">hiking in Colorado</a> or your local state park. This includes temperatures, wind, and precipitation. During the cooler season, snow, wind chill, and freezing temperatures can easily hinder a camping trip, so be sure to look up the historical data on a weather website before planning for your trip.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/hiking-in-winter.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Man hiking amongst snow covered mountains\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>The length of your trip is important because the longer you are outside in the elements the more likely you will encounter dangerous temperatures. If you have never camped in the winter before, you might make your first few outings short before building up toward longer trips. Aim for clear weather if possible too; this allows you to gradually build camping skills and experience toward harsher conditions like snow, ice, and wind chills.</p>\n<h3>Know Basic Survival Skills</h3>\n<p>Can you start a fire in the wind, rain, a snowstorm, or while ice pelts you? Do you know how to keep that fire going in severe conditions? While you might not be able to cozy up to a roaring fire, you should be able to produce enough heat to keep warm.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/tent-opened-to-mountains.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Tent opening in mountain area\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>You might consider a portable campfire. They burn for about 4.5 hours, and companies claim they&rsquo;re weatherproof, waterproof, and windproof. Buying and storing one for emergencies might be a good idea.</p>\n<h3>Re-think Your Personal Gear</h3>\n<p>When you sweat during the day the dampness seeps into your clothing, but it cannot evaporate fast enough. The trapped sweat can lower your body temperature in colder and below freezing environments and can lead to hypothermia. Sweat trapped in your sleeping bag can also do this. It can also leave you feeling clammy and feeling chilled to the bone.</p>\n<p>Layers will become your best friend. Two common problems are not wearing layers at all or not peeling off your clothes before you sweat too much. Remember, you want to feel comfortable, warm but not to the point where your body sweats. You should also consider packing extra clothes in case you do sweat too much. This way you can change and stay in dry clothes at all times.</p>\n<p>Make sure they are a lightweight breathable material that wicks moisture away from your body. Again, you want thin layers. You also want a snugger fit if you&rsquo;ll be active so the moisture wicking fabric performs properly, but a looser fit will suit a leisurely camping trip fine.</p>\n<p>Inside layering <a href=\"/blog/synthetic-fabric\">fabrics that wick moisture</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Nylon</li>\n    <li>Polyester</li>\n    <li>Synthetic Blends</li>\n    <li>Merino Wool/Wool blends</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Avoid cotton or cotton blends that are mostly cotton because it absorbs moisture. You can use these on your outer layers, such as sweatshirts and sweatpants, if you wear a wicking fabric against your skin.</p>\n<h3>3-season vs. 4-season Tents</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re camping in an area with below freezing temperatures, you will need a tent that can maintain the higher indoor temperatures. Some tents do this through a series of ventilation while others provide thicker walls or built-in heaters.</p>\n<p>A 4-season tent also stops the snow and ice from accumulating and allows it to naturally fall away. This prevents your ceiling from caving inward and leaks. Unless you&rsquo;re looking at subzero temperatures, including wind chills, and/or snow, a basic 4-season tent will carry you through your trip and keep you warm and dry. Look for the <a href=\"/best-waterproof-tent-for-rain\">best waterproof tent</a> to keep yourself and your gear dry during those wet and rainy trips in later winter and early spring.</p>\n<p>Few 3-season tents have the proper ventilation and construction to maintain a proper cabin temperature. One exception to this rule is camping in a mild winter climate, such as Florida, where the average nightly temperatures stay well above freezing. It&rsquo;s important to know the area&rsquo;s climate. <a href=\"/blog/autumn-camping-survival-guide\">Autumn is typically the last season</a> you\'ll get out of a 3-season tent.</p>\n<h3>What to Look For In A 4-Season Winter Tent</h3>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> choose a tent that is as small as possible for the size of your group. Most times, you want room to move about and stretch, but for winter camping, the differences in your proximity to your sleeping partner can help you stay warm or make you too cold.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\">\n        <img src=\"/img/tent-in-snow.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Tent in snow storm\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Steel poles:</strong> Lightweight tents need a lot of rigging to stay upright in strong winds, and they can collapse under the weight of ice and snow. Most lightweight and 3-season tents use aluminum or fiberglass, which aren&rsquo;t the best choices for winter camping.</p>\n<p><strong>Double walls:</strong> a 3-season tent has a single wall construction because it doesn&rsquo;t need to protect its occupants from below zero or sub-zero temperatures. Double walls give you extra insulation for harsher climates, but a single-wall tent will perform well in temperate areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Two entryways:</strong> you never know when or where Mother Nature will drop snow. Having multiple entries can ensure you&rsquo;re never blocked inside your tent. Plus, no one likes tripping over other people.</p>\n<h3>Choosing the Right Sleeping Bag</h3>\n<p>Most sleeping bags come with a season rating and a temperature guide, but the industry doesn&rsquo;t regulate this. Always rely on the actual temperature. For winter weather and harsh climates, you&rsquo;ll want a 4-season sleeping bag with a proper lining and a warm, insulated down material. Synthetic downs work as well as animal based ones in most scenarios, and they cost a lot less. Synthetics also do better in wet environments, including your sweat.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n        <img src=\"/img/tent-in-snowy-morning.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Tent in snow morning\">\n	</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>Style of sleeping bag might seem like a personal preference. In any other season it will be, but you will stay warmer and drier in a mummy style bag with a hood. Opt for quilting or baffles as these pockets hold insulation in place while trapping in heat.</p>\n<h3>Sleeping Pads</h3>\n<p>Sleeping pads offer you more than comfort; they also act as a layer of insulation and keep out the cold. You can purchase simple camping ones, use a yoga mat, or an exercise mat. The mats add shock absorption too, and they&rsquo;re fairly inexpensive.</p>\n<p>More Winter Camping Tips, Tricks, and Hacks:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Invest in metal tent stakes. Most tents come with plastic ones. They won\'t hold down your tent during moderate or heavy winds.</li>\n    <li>Make sure your tent has a fainfluy. Most 4-season tents come with one, but a handful of tents don\'t.</li>\n    <li>Weatherproof your tent, even if it already came with protective coating.</li>\n    <li>Don\'t forget to open your vents at night. Your tent still needs to breathe, and the vent designs optimize airflow without losing heat so that you stay warm and dry.</li>\n    <li>Keep your next day\'s clothes in your sleeping bag. This stops you from putting on cold clothes and lowering your body temperature. If possible, change inside your sleeping bag.</li>\n    <li>Use hand warmers as needed. They\'re safe to use inside your sleeing bag too, and some companies even make larger ones specifically for sleeping bags.</li>\n    <li>Store matches in a metal container. Plastic shatters, even the shatterproof variety. Have you ever dropped a cold or frozen container from the fridge and watched it&rsquo;s pieces and contents scatter? Don&rsquo;t attempt that with your matches.</li>\n    <li>Embrace the pee bottle. Camping can strip away so many comforts. If you need to pee, don&rsquo;t hold it or traipse through the cold. They make pee bottles for men and women, and you should have at least one for every camper.</li>\n    <li>Purchase extra tarps to quickly erect makeshift wind walls to protect you and your tent. You&rsquo;ll need extra rope and possibly stakes too, but rigging a tarp between two trees to block wind can make a huge difference in warmth.</li>\n    <li>Don&rsquo;t forget lanterns and extra batteries.</li>\n    <li>Investing in a small weather radio and bringing a cell phone can also add a layer of safety should fouler weather strike.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winter camping should be an adventure, and you should pitch your tent without worries about the cold or weather. Luckily, the 4-season tents, sleeping bags, and other cold weather equipment can ensure your winter camping trip is a complete success.

Take a look at our list of essential items for your next yard sale.','David Dacostashack','February 13, 2019','<p>If you&apos;re planning a yard sale or think you may host a booth at a <a href=\"/blog/trade-show-canopy-tent\">trade show</a> sometime soon, one thing you will not want to save for the last minute is stocking up on supplies. You do not need a whole lot of items to successfully hold a yard sale, but at a minimum, you should consider grabbing the essentials below.</p>\n<h3>Display Tables, Racks, etc...</h3>\n<p>You are going to need some way to display the items that you have for sale, which is probably going to be your biggest challenge. If you are lucky, you already have some <a href=\"https://www.eurmax.com/pop-up-table.html\" target=\"_blank\">display tables</a> and racks on hand.</p>\n<p>If you do not, you&apos;ll need to either purchase these items somewhere or borrow them. You may have accommodating family members or neighbors who will be willing to lend you the supplies for the sale. Do not forget to purchase hangers if you will be displaying clothing on racks.</p>\n <div class=\"row\">\n     <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n         <img src=\"/img/yard-sale-table.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"Man looking at books at a yard sale\">\n 	</div>\n </div>\n <br />\n<h3>Price Stickers</h3>\n<p>Some people are quite informal about pricing at yard sales, but others prefer to put a clear price on their items. If you fall into the latter category, you will need to purchase price stickers. Just do not forget to be open to negotiation. This can be essential in order to close a sale. If you do accept lower price offers, you may want to post a sign stating as much (see below).</p>\n<h3>Signage</h3>\n<p>You will need to purchase signs both to point the way to your yard sale from around the neighborhood and to help people who are browsing at your sale to find the types of items they are looking for.</p>\n<p>Signage also can help you to make certain bargains stand out. If somebody has the chance to save hundreds or thousands of dollars on a used item, draw attention to that deal with a prominent sign. It could make the difference between whether you make a sale or not. <a href=\"https://household-tips.thefuntimesguide.com/yard_sale_signs/\" target=\"_blank\">This article</a> is a great resource on making a creative yard sale sign.</p>\n<h3>Shopping Bags</h3>\n<p>You want it to be as easy as possible not just for shoppers to find what they are looking for, but also to take items home with them. To do this, purchase a bunch of shopping bags and have them ready when customers check out.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you should clearly display the shopping bags on the table next to you. That way, buyers who may be walking home will not forego a certain item because they think it will be unwieldy to carry with them.</p>\n<h3>Cash and Coins</h3>\n<p>You will have to be ready to make change when people check out their items. You can save yourself a bit of grief by pricing everything with whole numbers (this way, you do not need to stock up on rolls of coins). But you will definitely need to have an assortment of bills ($1, $5, $10 and $20 bills at a minimum; if you are selling pricier items, you might want to grab some $50 bills too).</p>\n<h3>Calculator</h3>\n<p>Nobody wants to stand around waiting while you try to do math in your head, even if you are great at arithmetic. Plus, even if you are fast, people may not trust your math if they do not see you punching numbers into a calculator.</p>\n<p>So make sure that you have one, and that you pick up an extra battery for it as well. Calculator batteries last a very long time on average, but you still do not want to risk your calculator quitting in the middle of the day.</p>\n<h3>Water bottle and Snacks</h3>\n<p>You are likely going to be spending hours outside, if not the entire day. Sitting there, especially in the bright sun, you are likely to get dehydrated if you are not drinking lots of water.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t force yourself to go inside to grab water or snacks. Make life easy on yourself by getting a big water bottle. As far as snack food goes, obviously you should refrain from eating when people are checking out or talking to you, but there is nothing wrong with keeping yourself fueled up for a long day.</p>\n<h3>Pop up Canopy Tent</h3>\n<p>Speaking of the hot, bright sun, you will be way more comfortable during your yard sale if you don&rsquo;t have those harsh rays beating down on you. Get a <a href=\"/\">canopy tent</a> and enjoy sitting in the shade. You&rsquo;ll be less hot, less likely to get dehydrated, and less likely to get sunburned too.</p>\n<p>Your shoppers might also appreciate some relief from the sun, so think about getting one or two more tents and setting them up to shade your displays. The more comfortable you make the shopping experience, the more time customers will be willing to spend browsing your items. The longer they spend shopping, the more sales you will likely make.</p>\n<h3>Trash bin</h3>\n<p>Sadly, people may feel like throwing trash away while they are in your yard. To keep it from ending up <em>on </em>your yard, get a large trash bin and set it out in plain view. Hopefully, waste will end up in the bin and not in your flower beds.</p>\n<h3>At least one person to help</h3>\n<p>A person isn&rsquo;t really an &ldquo;item&rdquo; of course, but it is worth mentioning lastly that you will have a tough time running a yard sale on your own. While you may be able to manage the customers, no one will be there to safeguard your items while you are in the bathroom. Plus, a yard sale is a lot more fun with a friend!</p>\n<p><strong>With These Essential Supplies, You Will Be Well Prepared for Your Yard Sale</strong></p>\n<p>Now you know everything you need to set up for your next yard sale. While it will take some time and effort to gather these supplies, you&rsquo;ll be glad that you did. You&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy a more comfortable, relaxed day, and your customers will have a better shopping experience. That should in turn lead to a more successful day with more items cleared out of your home and more money in the bank!</p>','/img/yard-sale-items.jpg','Misc'),('zshade-review',81,'Z-Shade 10x10 Instant Shade Review','How does this popular Z-Shade canopy compare to the likes of similar tents from Ozark Trail and Quest?','Phil Wendie','July 2, 2022','<p>In our series to determine if value brand canopy tents are worth the potential savings over feature-rich tents from better-known brands, we put the two types of tents through a series of reviews. After reviewing the Ozark Trail <a href=\"/\">10x10 instant shelter</a> we couldn&apos;t leave out its closest competition, the <a href=\"https://www.zshadeusa.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Z-Shade</a> tent. Z-Shade has been a staple in manufacturing instant canopies in a variety of sizes and colors since 2000. The brand is wholly owned by large conglomerate Activa Leisure Group who has been in the umbrella and shade business since 1842, so it&apos;s safe to say they know a thing or two about outdoor canopies.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n   <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n       <img src=\"/img/zshade-canopy-beach.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"ZShade Beach Canopy\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n   </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n\n<h2>A long history in producing shade</h2>\n<p>In 2008, Activa opened a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility designed exclusively to produce instant canopy tents. With a focus on manufacturing private label tents for other outdoor tent brands, growth exploded within three short years and they had to expand the facility just to keep up with demand. Where did all of this demand come from? Z-Shade was the exclusive licensee and manufacturer for <a href=\"/#review41\">EZ Up</a> at the time, where they produced a number of their canopy series and components to help EZ Up meet their demand.</p>\n<h3>Retail partnerships</h3>\n<p>Once they expanding their manufacturing capabilities, Activa began producing canopies for retail shelves under their own Z-Shade brand. They signed exclusive partnerships with Sam&apos;s Club, Lowe&apos;s, Academy Sports, K-Mart, and started filling the shelves with affordably priced instant shelters of all shapes and sizes. Many of those exclusive partnerships are still in tact today and is where majority of where sales take place.</p>\n<p>Each big-box store has its own exclusive Z-Shade model, but the one most comparable to the Ozark Trail is their 10x10 angled leg outdoor canopy sold on Amazon, so we thought it would be a good tent to review to compare the two.</p>\n<h3>Pyramid frame</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/blog/cross-truss-vs-pyramid\">pyramid</a> frame design is made of durable and powder-coated steel that is resistant to rust and corrosion. The steel legs are almost exactly the same thickness as the <a href=\"/blog/ozark-trail-review\">Ozark Trail</a> and similar to that of most cheaper tents, but it&apos;s still noticeably thinner than any commercial-grade shelter. The trusses are thin but actually hold up surprisingly well under stress when rotational pressure is applied. The truss connectors are adequate in terms of durability and will help to support the pyramid frame maintain structural integrity during mild to moderate <a href=\"/blog/tips-for-using-your-canopy-tent-in-the-wind\">windy</a> conditions. Anything more than 15-20 mph winds and you might find your Z-Shade tent starting to buckle where it shouldn&apos;t be buckling.</p>\n<h3>Angled legs and 10x10 footprint</h3>\n<p>The telescoping <a href=\"/blog/straight-vs-slant-legged-canopy\">angled legs</a> are well designed and slide smoothly until locked into place of one of the 3 leg lock positions, a choice we always love having the ability to make. The angled legs add a bit more stability than straight-leg tents which we also like, but the design reduces the top canopy to 8&apos;x8&apos; dimensions resulting in only 64 sq. ft. of shade. The plastic foot pads are a nice touch that you don&apos;t often see on value-priced tents and they do a good job of protecting the bottom of the legs from wear and tear. Similar to nearly every 10x10 shade canopy <a href=\"/blog/best-canopy-tent-under-100\">under $100</a>, the legs utilize metal insta-lock push buttons that are not the most user friendly. With this feature there is always a need to worry about rusted metal thumb locks that become impossible to push in over time. Cheap tents generally tend to forego a lot of these nice-to-have features that make canopy tent life easier during set up, and unfortunately this one is no different.</p>\n<h3>Canopy fabric</h3>\n<p>The canopy fabric material features the brands signature hallmark, white-colored seems that run the length of each corner up to the peak of the tent. It&apos;s an easy way to spot a Z-Shade canopy and one that we think adds dimension to the top and that highlights the steeply angled edges. One popular drawback to these seams is that many users report leaking when it rains because they are not heat sealed stitching, so keep that in mind if you find yourself underneath and caught in a downpour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n   <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n       <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3R4Q5Im\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/img/zshade-10x10-angled-leg-tent.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"ZShade 10x10 Shelter\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/></a>\n   </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n\n<p>The material is one of the most unique features of this tent, comprising of a polyester taffeta-vented top with a 190-denier silver coating that provides 50+ UPF protection. It offers the best UV protection of any canopy material and the polyester material also has water-resistant features (aside from the seams) and has been treated to resist fading from the sun, features that we really like. The canopy has a peak eave height of 6&apos;3&quot; and peak apex of 10&apos;5&quot;, so some of your <a href=\"/blog/best-tent-for-tall-person\">taller friends</a> might have to duck under the valance when entering the tent.</p>\n<h3>Set up and portability</h3>\n<p>Setting up the tent is a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-set-up-a-canopy-tent\">simple</a> as extending the frame and raising the legs into place, and can be done by just one person in a few minutes, nothing unique or out of the ordinary here. The tent weights a lightweight 31 lbs. which is in line with most in its class. The included carrying bag is made of denier polyester and is pretty well constructed. It has a single zipper closure with double stitching and also features an adjustable nylon shoulder strap for easy transport. Four metal stakes are also included to provide some extra stability and keep the tent from blowing away in strong gusts of wind.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation</h3>\n<p>Overall, we think the Z-Shade 10x10 pyramid canopy is a good value buy for anyone in the market for a cheap but durable and protective sun shelter. It&apos;s one of the most popular value brand models on Amazon and has some of the best customer reviews to back up its quality claims. Perfect for a small family at the <a href=\"/best-beach-canopy\">beach</a>, backyard gathering, or weekend soccer tournament. The UV protected canopy is one of the best we&apos;ve seen on any affordable 10x10 tent. But we must caution anyone looking to purchase to understand that the lifespan of these typically do not exceed one or two seasons. But if you&apos;re looking for an inexpensive option that will serve you well in that timeframe, you can&apos;t go wrong with this Z-Shade instant sun shelter.</p>','/img/review.jpg','Review');

It was founded in 1999 and is currently operating out of La Mirada, California. Like E-Z Up, Caravan Canopy has expanded and now produces other products like folding chairs. Caravan Canopy has also ventured into the digital printing industry and offer custom graphic printing, which makes them a viable option for large public events. Because they are a relatively new company, there isn’t much information that we felt necessary to include in this review. Our opinion of the brand is more so driven by the quality of their product, and less influenced by the history of the brand as are our opinions of some of our other top brands.</p>\n\n<h4>Review</h4>\n<p>The reason that we are such big supporters of Caravan Canopy is because we believe that their lower end commercial grade canopy tents are arguably the best all-purpose canopies on the market. Similar to more well-known brands like Coleman and E-Z Up, Caravan produces affordable models that often sell below $100. These models are comparable to other inexpensive canopies that we have reviewed, but don’t stick out as being more valuable. That being said, if you are willing to spend the extra money, in the low $200 range, you can great value for your dollar. What we love about Caravan is that they have an affordable commercial product line. Their commercial canopies are inexpensive enough that you could justify buying one for recreational use, but durable enough that you could use them for commercial events or in harsh weather conditions.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n		<img src=\"/img/caravan_brand_pup.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Caravan canopy tent with dog\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the picture above, which I took from the company\'s website, you can see another market that Caravan is trying to tap into. We know that these are novelty products, but we like that Caravan is thinking outside the box. We haven’t review any of their pet canopy tents, yet. I can’t get my dog to sit still for more than 2 seconds so it has been hard for me to get any legitimate feedback from the target market.</p>\n<p>Setting humor aside, we are big advocates for Caravan Canopy tents for consumers looking for something a little more durable than the average mass-marketed affordable canopy.  They are inexpensive and portable enough that they are still good for soccer games or beach use, but they are also strong enough that you could feel comfortable knowing that your shelter will protect your goods if a thunderstorm interrupts your craft show.</p>','https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_in_c_p_89_2?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A3375251%2Cn%3A%213375301%2Cn%3A706814011%2Cn%3A3400371%2Cn%3A10208056011%2Cn%3A3401821%2Cp_89%3ACaravan+Canopy%7CCaravan+Sports&bbn=3401821&ie=UTF8&qid=1488311369&rnid=2528832011&_encoding=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=35a20a9c54c708af5c13e6b1333a003c&camp=1789&creative=9325'),('Coleman','http://www.coleman.com/coleman-history-us.html','/img/coleman_logo.jpg','<h4>History</h4>\n<p>In the early 1900s, W.C. Coleman discovered that gasoline could be used to fuel lanterns, creating a white flame instead of the yellow flame that was produced by most of the standard kerosene lanterns of the time. The gas-burning lantern became the bedrock that the Coleman company was founded on, and is reflected in their logo. Over the course of the next 50 years the lantern business expanded to stoves, the business grew, and soon many American soldiers fighting in World War II were being issued Coleman products as part of their standard issued gear.</p>\n<p>After the war the company kept expanding and by the early 2000s Coleman was producing over 15 million outdoor recreation products per year. It also bought child companies such as Esky, Aerobed, Sevylor, Stearns, and Puddle Jumper. The company is currently owned by Newell Brands.  Coleman employs over 3000 employees in Kansas, Texas, and Colorado, but most of these jobs are management positions. The majority of Coleman products are manufactured in China.</p>\n<h4>Review</h4>\n<p>When you walk back to the sporting goods department of your local Wal-Mart, you will most likely find a wall of Coleman products. The fact that their products are inexpensive and mass produced has lead to sustainable revenue for the company, but has also lead to a tarnished brand reputation. Coleman doesn’t want to be known as a middle-of-the-road, cheap, brand. So in 2011 the brand took a step in a different direction. They brought in a new CEO, Robert Marcovitch from K2 sports, moved their operations from Kansas to Colorado, and hired an entirely new design team. Coleman’s vision for the future is to be in the same league as brands known for quality, aesthetics, and modern technology. They would like to be in the same retail class as companies like The North Face, Marmot, Patagonia, etc. It is our opinion that it will be a long time before the brand will be seen as a high quality sporting goods company, but during the transition period we believe that you can get good value for your dollar when purchasing a Coleman product.</p>\n<p>When a brand seeks to elevate their image, the first step is to actually create a higher quality product. In the past 5 years Coleman has spent money to increase the quality of their products. They have made a push to produce lighter, more durable, tents to market to more extreme backpackers. As a result of this push, we have seen that the fabric that is used by their canopies has increased in quality as well. The great part about Coleman being in a transition period is that they still rely on big name stores for the majority of their revenue, and therefore must remain affordable. Because the public’s image of the brand has not yet increased into the same class as the premium retailers, Coleman cannot demand North Face prices. That benefits the consumer because it means that you can get better quality for your dollar.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">\n            <img src=\"/img/coleman_alaska.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Coleman canopy tent next to VW Bus\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>Overall we are pleased with the quality that we have seen in Coleman Canopy Tents. We haven’t been blown away, but we think that their tents are worth the price and are the best quality that you can get from large retail stores like Wal-Mart. For the foreseeable future, while Coleman is in a brand-image transition period, you should be able to get good quality for a lower price. My first personal canopy tent, before I began reviewing them professionally, was a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Straight-Instant-Canopy-Gazebo/dp/B018NKHCHM/ref=sr_1_11?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1488227353&sr=1-11&keywords=coleman+10x10+instant+canopy\">Coleman 10”x10” Instant Canopy</a> and it treated me very well. Above, you can see a picture of it while I was camping outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. Even with newer technology available I would still recommend it to all of our readers, and I continue use it today.</p>','https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=lp_3401821_nr_p_89_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A3375251%2Cn%3A%213375301%2Cn%3A706814011%2Cn%3A3400371%2Cn%3A10208056011%2Cn%3A3401821%2Cp_89%3AColeman&bbn=3401821&ie=UTF8&qid=1488234106&rnid=2528832011&_encoding=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=7d9c1bc2cd09e6626cdd6028e66da083&camp=1789&creative=9325'),('Core','https://www.coreequipment.com/pages/team','/img/core_logo.png','<h4>History</h4>\n\n<p>We enjoy talking about the roots of the Core Equipment Company because its story is one that really epitomizes the so-called American Dream. We live in uncertain times and it is often difficult to leave the comfort of a steady job to pursue a dream, but that is exactly how the brand was created. The founders left their stable corporate jobs with reputable outdoor brands to see if they could produce something better. They are a privately owned company, operating out of the heart of the northwest. Kansas to be specific. There mission statement says that gear should never hold anybody back, especially when it comes to outdoor adventures. And they seek to manufacture high quality equipment that supports that mission.</p>\n\n<h4>Review</h4>\n\n<p>What we like most about the Core brand is that they are a founder-led company. When you are a small and agile company, you can truly focus on quality and customer satisfaction because the customer is your only stakeholder. Core is a small team of camping enthusiasts who are trying to encourage consumers to get outside and enjoy the outdoors and not to be intimated if its your first time. They market their equipment towards newer enthusiasts and sell a product that is simple and effective. When it comes to canopy tents we have always found that simplicity is usually better, so we support their mission.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n	<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n		<img src=\"/img/core_brand.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"Core equipment mission statement\" style=\"max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;\"/>\n	</div>\n</div>\n<p>The people that make up the leadership of Core Equipment is a team of outdoor enthusiasts. The founders are old friends. You can almost feel this laid back friendliness in their product design. Many companies market aggressive cutting edge technology, which is exciting but can also be intimidating and expensive. The team at Core is targeting the people who want to just get out and enjoy a weekend, and not necessarily climb Denali.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that Core canopy tents are built with comparable quality to the other brands that we have reviewed. Their products are less expensive than most of the other brands, though. This low price tag makes the brand more enticing, especially for customers who will be purchasing a shelter for low impact weather.  Core is sold at major retailers like Kmart, Walmart, and Sears. They are trying to be competitive with brands like Coleman and EZ-Up by manufacturing an affordable product. Overall we believe that their quality is similar, so their lower price tag makes Core shelters a good purchase.</p>','https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_89_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A2972638011%2Ck%3Acore+shelter%2Cp_89%3ACORE+Equipment&bbn=2972638011&keywords=core+shelter&ie=UTF8&qid=1489969687&rnid=2528832011&_encoding=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=c32464a92605b34fc208763376f48a64&camp=1789&creative=9325'),('Eurmax','https://www.eurmax.com/','/img/eurmax-logo.jpg','<p>If you have spent any time in Southern California at all, you probably have learned one thing about its climate—and that is that it is hot and sunny pretty much year-round. There are days you may feel desperate for the smallest puff of cloud to drift in front of the sun.</p>\n\n<p>So it is no surprise that a popular and highly rated pop-up canopy tent manufacturer would hail from that part of the world, and that would be Eurmax Canopy. This brand is headquartered in El Monte, which is located just east of LA.</p>\n\n<p>With more than 15 years of experience manufacturing quality canopy tents, Eurmax has the expertise to produce quality sun shelters time and again.

Pieces were missing and the canopy was unable to stand. Hot and frustrated, Mark fantasized about a portable pop-up canopy tent that didn\'t require any loose parts. He began working on his idea the following day in his parent’s garage in southern California. In just a few months, Mark turned his fantasy into a reality and built his first instant canopy tent prototype under the brand name E-Z Up. By the following year demand had grown enough where Mark could no longer work out of his parent’s basement so he moved to a friends warehouse. At first Mark worked out of a corner of the warehouse, identified by a square on the ground made out of masking tape. But the operation grew quickly and within a short amount of time Mark took over the whole warehouse. The warehouse owner, Brad Smith, was an experienced international businessman and eventually partnered with Mark. Brad’s operational expertise combined with Mark’s ingenious product created a perfect partnership and built the foundation for E-Z Up’s success.</p>\n\n<p>Today, E-Z Up operates out of a 125,000 sq. ft. headquarters in Norco, CA and has offices in the Netherlands, and Hong Kong. Many of the manufacturing jobs are in China and Mexico. E-Z Up products are sold in over 100 countries. The breadth of the business has expanded to a wide range of folding products such as flags, chairs, tables, umbrellas, and more. E-Z Up has become a competitive leader in the digital printing industry as well. Mark and Brad realized that many of the settings that canopy tents are used are appropriate for advertisements and that customers may want to put logos or slogans on their canopies. This idea led them in a new direction that has become lucrative for the company. E-Z Up’s digital printing is used by 9 out of the top 10 fortune 500 companies. In the image below, taken from E-Z Up\'s official website, you can see an example of how their digital printing has opened new doors for the company.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n            <img src=\"/img/ez_up_brand_golf.jpg\" class=\"img-rounded\" alt=\"E-Z Up canopy tent at golf event\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h4>Review</h4>\n<p>E-Z Up is founded on the canopy tent product. Unlike Coleman and some of the other sporting goods brands, E-Z Up’s main focus is canopy tents. There are pros and cons to having a niche business. Specialized companies like E-Z Up are at the forefront of product innovation because it is all that they focus on. When you buy an E-Z Up canopy tent, you are buying a product that is the sole representation of the brand. This is good because it means that E-Z Up has put all of their resources into making sure that they have created the best quality product that they can. They need their product to perform because the reputation of the company is on the line. The drawback to a specialized company is that, it doesn’t have access to many of the material and logistical resources that a larger company may have. Sometimes the result of this is higher prices, although we have not seen a gap between E-Z Up prices and prices of larger competitors like Coleman.</p>\n\n<p>From our experience with E-Z Ups we have been impressed. They have different models to nicely fit the price requirements and pysical needs of the consumer. Their affordable models are still made with quality and are surprisingly durable. If you need a canopy that can withstand harsh elements, they have more expensive models that are built to last. Overall I think that E-Z Up provides good value for the money. Their canopies are competitively priced and functional. Their affordable products are fine for recreational users, and their premium products can be trusted to withstand extreme weather conditions. I would recommend this brand to all of our readers.</p>','https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_in_-2_p_89_12?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A3375251%2Cn%3A%213375301%2Cn%3A706814011%2Cn%3A3400371%2Cn%3A10208056011%2Cp_89%3AE-Z+UP&bbn=10208056011&ie=UTF8&qid=1488297490&rnid=2528832011&_encoding=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=162cbbd693bdc5944c3384fbc595b640&camp=1789&creative=9325');

With it\'s durable, stylish design and its incredible ease-of-use, the Core offers great bang for your buck.','4.7','https://amzn.to/2vQPErD','<p><a href=\"/brands#Core\" target=\"_blank\">Core Equipment</a> is a brand that is best known for manufacturing high-quality camping tents—but it turns out they also make some fabulous canopy tents. This company is all about creating products that will enhance any outdoor adventure whether it is in the backyard, beach, or mountains. Our research led us to Core Equipment because we saw high demand for their products from our readers and really wanted to see for ourselves if their best canopy tent would hold up to our vigorous testing. The pop up canopy that held up exceptionally well during our research, better than some of the most expensive pop up tents on the market, was the 10x10 Instant Shelter canopy. For this specific tent, their engineers committed to an attractive aesthetic design that was both easy to use and would last through some of the toughest conditions and seasons. This 10x10 pop up shelter is a straight leg design providing 100 square feet of shade that we found will be a pleasant compliment to any day under the sun. It&apos;s the best pop up canopy our team has reviewed, hands down.</p>\n \n<p>Even before we took this pop-up canopy tent out of the bag, we loved it. The carrying tote boasted a full-length zipper, in contrast with the typical canopy tent bag that features a zipper around the top. We found the full zipper was much easier to use in removing and packing up the tent. We also love that there are straps included in the bag that can wrap around the steel frame to help compress the shelter which aids in removing additional stress on the full length zipper. We all know how difficult it can be to zipper a fully packed bag and these straps helped tremendously in reducing strain. We love the thought Core Equipment put into these features because so many manufacturers make the carrying bag an afterthought, but we have found that the bag is a large determinant of portability and is one most important aspects consumers look at before making a purchase.</p>\n \n<p>Now that we&apos;ve explained why we love the carrying bag, let&apos;s talk about the tent itself! We found the one-piece steel frame to be durable with solid reinforced plastic hinges at the joints to help maintain its structure during above average wind gusts. We had this instant shelter set up continuously for 3 weeks, which included two significant storms, and it held up exceptionally well and is still as steady as it was on day one. We think one of the best features is the oversized pinch-free buttons on the top canopy locks and the leg adjusters, helping make setup extremely easily and hassle free. Core advertises this tent as an &apos;instant 2 minute setup&apos;, and we definitely agree with their claim. Easily slide the top locks into place, then choose between the three leg lock adjustments for the canopy height. We really enjoyed the option of three height adjustments, especially on those windy or rainy days. When conditions got too windy or rainy, we dropped the tent to its lowest setting. Doing so improved stability and kept out more rain.</p>\n \n<p>While the tent&apos;s frame is impressive, what is arguably even more outstanding is the canopy itself. A proprietary technology unique to Core, the H20 Block technology applied to 150D polyester is one of the best materials we found on a pop up canopy tent because it is so lightweight, waterproof, and yet surprisingly durable. During our testing it repelled water much better than most of the other canopy materials, even though most other tents had higher denier polyester which is a true testament to their H20 Block technology. The seams going from the valance to the peak are double sealed for added weather protection, so that there is no need to worry about leaks causing water to permeate though these vulnerable points in the fabric. The material is taken down over the eaves on the corners to the leg lock adjustments, which we found helps to keep the cover tight and secure on the frame as well as increase stability.</p>\n \n<p>Another cool thing about the canopy is that it has a neat contemporary look that you won&apos;t find with other tents. We found the silver colored polyester helps to reflect heat, and the dual vents at the top allow for additional circulation. This is lightyears ahead of the vent-less darker colored covers that seem to radiate and trap the heat underneath. Not only do these vents keep those underneath cool, but they allow a breeze to pass through the top during windy days and helps prevent gusts from turning the shelter into a sail. The canopy itself is rated 50+ UPF which is the highest UV protection rating for canopies so rest assured on those hot sunny days that your skin is well protected from UVA and UVB rays. Lastly, we found the welded steel feet to be good quality and easily allow the included stakes to pass through and keep the tent secure. We also used the guy line tie downs for extra support during our testing, and they helped to reduce cross breeze tension of the steel frame and increased stability.</p>\n \n<p>One more thing you are probably wondering about is how much this pop-up canopy tent weighs. The included carrying case that we highlighted above comes with two web handles and built in wheels make it manageable to transport to beach or campground. We can&apos;t recommend this recreational tent enough, and in our opinion it is the best pop up canopy available today for any outdoor adventure.</p>\n \n<p><strong>Set up :</strong> completed in 4:10 minutes with 1 person, and 2:19 minutes with 2 people</p>\n<p><strong>Teardown :</strong> completed in 3:09 minutes with 1 person and 1:33 minutes with 2 people</p>',NULL,NULL),(2,1,6,'Coleman','10\'x10\' Instant Sun Shelter','/img/best-10x10-canopy.jpg','Coleman manufactured this canopy tent with one thing in mind: quality.

But did you know they have also designed one of the best pop-up canopy tents ever manufactured, the Coleman 10x10 instant canopy? It&apos;s clear that Coleman leveraged their knowledge and long history of manufacturing outdoor equipment with this shelter because one word consistently came up during our review, quality. Providing 100 square feet of shade, we applaud this 10x10 straight leg canopy tent is for its portability, ease of use, and visually appealing aesthetic. The white awning material and light green valance provide a stark contrast to the often solid, boring canopy and will certainly give everyone around canopy envy. The additional coverage down the steel legs hides the locking mechanisms at the top and adjustable legs and helps to keep the material tight to prevent water puddling on the material.</p>\n \n<p>One of the features we were most impressed with when we started checking out this canopy tent is the recently-introduced proprietary pinch-free Comfort Grip technology. Resembling a large handle like device, we found sliding the Comfort Grip up the telescoping pole effortless until it locked into place with an easy click. The Comfort Grip is found on both the top canopy lock and the adjustable leg locks and is designed with the goal of preventing people to not have to reach above their head. In order to be successful in this claim we suggest opening the frame of the canopy with two people, and first locking the top canopy into place, then raising the telescoping legs up until they lock into place. This way, users will actually not have to reach above the chest and it makes setup a breeze. Similarly, when it&apos;s time to take the pop up canopy down, release the bottom leg locks first, and then when the legs slide down release the top locks second. The tent will easily collapse on itself making packing away into the carrying tote stress-free.</p>\n \n<p>Another feature we really love is the rugged Polyguard 2X polyester material. This fabric is extra-thick, and it is coated with heavy-duty proprietary UVGuard technology. We found the UVGuard offers one of the best UV filters on the market with 50+ UPF that will protect anyone underneath from the dangerous UVA and UVB rays of the sun. UPF is Ultraviolet Protection Factor which measures the UV protection on a material, similar to that of SPF on the skin. 50+ UPF translates to the canopy allowing only 1/50th or 2% of the UV radiation hitting it to pass through, which is as good as it gets in terms of sun protection.</p>\n \n<p>At the top of the vaulted ceiling are two vent flaps that allow a breeze to pass through and release heat. So, even on a hot summer day, you can stay cool while enjoying the shade. These flaps also help allow air to circulate and pass through the material to foil any attempt of the shelter to blow away during those windy days. As always, we highly recommend using the ground stakes and pre-attached guy lines, even during good conditions, as an aid to securing your shelter properly and safely.</p>\n \n<p>Coleman manufactured this sun shelter with a steel frame. This frame is incredibly strong, but it also keeps the weight down for portability. Weighing in around 37 lbs., this pyramid frame is one of the lighter 10x10 canopy footprint on the market, perfect for those outdoor enthusiasts who are constantly on the move.</p>\n \n<p>Portability is a big ranking factor in our best of pop up canopy tent reviews because we know it is one of the biggest influences in our readers purchasing decision. Frequent trips to the beach, a child&apos;s soccer tournament, a community event, or a picnic in the backyard; we love recommending shelters that are easy and convenient to get around and load into a car. In addition to weight, the quality of the wheeled carrying bag is another crucial consideration with respect to portability. Coleman did a fantastic job, incorporating high-quality materials, double stitched web handles, and solid plastic wheels. Both the tent and its case should hold up to years of use.</p>\n\n<p>The last feature we want to highlight is the option for an additional Coleman 10x10 sunwall that goes perfectly with this pop up canopy. While focusing on the quality of various canopy tents, it is easy to overlook the fact that not all sidewalls are equal in terms of quality. The Coleman 10x10 sidewall is among the best out there. Constructed with the same UVGuard material as the awning material, it provides 50+ UPF sun protection and is a heavy duty, yet surprisingly lightweight polyester. In additional to the UV protection this sunwall offers, an overlooked benefit is the additional privacy that it provides. Perfect for any crowded day at the beach; this is the best canopy sunwall and it goes perfectly with this Coleman instant shelter.</p>\n \n<p><strong>Set up :</strong> completed in 3:18 minutes with 1 person, and 1:37 minute with 2 people</p>\n<p><strong>Teardown :</strong> completed in 2:49 minutes with 1 person, and 1:22 minute with 2 people</p>',NULL,NULL),(3,1,1,'Eurmax','Basic 10x10 Pop Up Commercial Canopy','/img/best-canopy-tent.jpg','Shopping for commercial grade performance on a budget? This is the least expensive cross-truss frame canopy on our list. The Eurmax is our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best overall value</span> because it offers uncompromising quality at a reasonable price.','4.8','https://amzn.to/3druqou','<p>Over the past 15 years, <a href=\"/brands#Eurmax\" target=\"_blank\">Eurmax</a> has built a reputation as one of the most successful brands in manufacturing commercial-grade pop-up canopy tents. They built their reputation by providing customers with fantastic service, quality, and value. We reviewed a number of Eurmax canopy tents and tested them side by side with other commercial grade instant shelters, and the Eurmax Basic 10x10 Pop Up Commercial Outdoor Canopy was the leader of the pack in terms of value. It is the least expensive canopy in the Eurmax line, but still offers so many useful commercial grade features that we find it difficult to decide where to begin.</p>\n \n<p>We&apos;ll start with what we believe is the hallmark feature of this canopy tent, the sturdiness and stability of the frame. The tent owes its considerable strength to the commercial-grade full cross-truss steel design that braces the legs and supports the roof. If you want your shelter to give you years of use, a cross-truss frame is arguably the single most important feature to look for.</p>\n \n<p>After testing dozens of tents, we have found that cross-truss frames outperform traditional pyramid frames, offering greater strength and Stability. The Eurmax Basic 10x10 Pop Up Canopy is no exception to this trend. We have found that Eurmax delivers one of the strongest frames we have seen amongst shelters at the recreational canopy tent price point. The frame is well engineered with reinforced joints so the shelter is able to withstand stress from the sides just as well as it is able to withstand direct pressure from above. The hammertone powder-coated finish on the steel frame gives it an industrial feel and is much stronger than the thinner aluminium frames of most competitors. We do recommend two people handle the setup of this tent since it weighs around 51 pounds, but one person working alone could handle it if necessary.</p>\n \n<p>For the top locks and telescoping leg locks, Eurmax uses a Thumb-Lock slider which is much easier to use than the traditional thumb-button style frame locking mechanisms. The spring-loaded lever locks into place during set up, making it very easy to unlock the frame with one hand and pull down on the truss with the other hand when it is time to teardown. This feature also reduces the risk of pinching your fingers, something that has happened more times than we care to admit with other tents. A quick push of the spring-loaded lever releases the telescoping legs and you can choose one of the three height settings.</p>\n \n<p>At its peak, this tent is 11.1 feet, which makes it the tallest canopy tent we&apos;ve reviewed to date. So, even tall users will be able to stand comfortably under the shelter. This makes it particularly useful for commercial settings such as trade shows where you need to be able to accommodate anyone who might stop by. And as always, the straight leg design with a 10x10 frame will provide 100 sq. feet of shade for maximum protection from the elements. One of the less obvious, but beneficial, features of this canopy tent is the Velcro that spans the entire edge of the valence. By including Velcro along the edge of the canopy fabric, Eurmax makes it easy to attach a hanging wall. Compared to other hanging walls which clip or zipper onto the valance, our team found that Velcro was the quickest and most convenient method of attaching a canopy wall. A sidewall can easily be hung with just one person in a very short amount of time. So, if your intended use is for a trade show, promotional booth, farmers market, or fair; this is the best pop up canopy for you.</p>\n \n<p>This canopy tent comes with 8 x 250mm stakes and .8&quot; guy ropes. Hands down, it is the best tie-down set that we have come across. Both the stakes and ropes are high in quality and are made of sturdy materials. Also included is a carry bag with big 2.7&quot; diameter wheels. The reinforced carrying bag is important because the shelter is one of the heaviest that we have reviewed in this category, weighing in at just over 50 lbs. The carrying case is constructed with high quality and is built to support the extra load. The wheels are on a wide axel, making rolling the bag across concrete or sand much easier than most that are built into the bottom of the bag and helps to prevent speed wobbles that cause the bag to topple. If you want a durable, professional and easy-to-setup instant shelter then we strongly recommend this Eurmax, it makes a strong case for the best 10x10 canopy tent available today.</p>\n \n<p><strong>Setup :</strong> completed in 4:21 minutes with 1 person, and 2:39 minutes with 2 people</p>\n<p><strong>Teardown :</strong> completed in 3:19 minutes with 1 person, and 2:11 with 2 people</p>','Best 10x10 Canopy',1),(4,99,5,'E-Z UP','Dome Instant Shelter Canopy 10 x 10','/img/best-canopy.jpg','The quickest to set up and also the lightest canopy on our list, the EZ-Up Dome is our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best easy-to-use canopy</span>.

That recognition didn&apos;t happen overnight though. For years the engineers at E-Z UP listened to customers on how to improve the design and increase the ease of use of their canopies. The 10x10 Dome Instant Shelter Canopy is the culmination of all that effort in an attempt to make the best canopy tent on the market. Customers said they wanted a lighter weight tent that was easily portable but durable enough to withstand adverse conditions. They wanted a vented canopy to allow heat to escape and facilitate a more relaxing environment. They wanted the convenience of easy setup and tear down. But most of all they wanted a quality shelter that can withstand years of repeated use. This 10x10 canopy tent meets all of those requirements with a balanced design that is versatile enough to support a range of uses and sturdy enough to offer shelter for years.</p>\n \n<p>Let&apos;s kick things off with a close look at the most unique feature of this shelter: the canopy itself. This is the first time we have seen the ceiling of a pop up shelter made from composite fiber rods. We found this distinctive canopy frame creates an aerodynamic roof support structure that can actually bend for added resistance to the wind. Compared to the typical ridged steel or aluminum trusses which are vulnerable to damage from strong wind, the composite rods allow the roof to flex in the same direction as the wind, reducing the risk of cracking at brittle joints. So, if you are a beachgoer, or you simply live in a really windy part of the world, you are going to love this feature. You&apos;ll be ready for occasional or sustained wind gusts. When the wind is not blowing, the composite rods bow upwards to create a dome ceiling for maximum headroom creating a max height of 9&apos;1&quot;.</p>\n \n<p>This design is one of a kind and although there is probably a better to describe it, we like to say it&apos;s just plain cool looking. Attached to the composite rods is the powder coated aluminum frame. We were impressed with how rugged and stable this frame is, and we love that the powder coating helps to protect it from tarnishing from rain or humidity. We love that EZ-Up chose an aluminum frame over the typical steel because it reduces weight making this tent much easier to tote around. It&apos;s worth mentioning that although the canopy tent footprint is 10x10, the tapered leg design reduces actual canopy coverage to 8x8 so it does not provide the full 100 sq. feet of shade people have come accustomed to with a 10x10 footprint structure. However, the benefit of slanted legs is an improvement in stability and wind resistance so we found it to be a worthwhile trade-off in this case. The frame is painted in a color that compliments the canopy itself, providing a great aesthetic which is something a lot of canopies lack. The option to choose between 6 different fabric colors and 4 coordinating frame colors is an added bonus.</p>\n \n<p>In line with the aesthetic, the canopy top features slightly curved valences, which is something we think really adds to its great looks. It&apos;s a subtle detail, but it shows that EZ-Up wants to impress. Something else we like are the ventilation cuts that are located up near the peak of the canopy. As we all know, warm air rises and can get trapped below the canopy material with nowhere to go even on breezy days. The vents allow the hot air to escape and the temperature underneath to remain cool. At the same time, these vents provide increased stability during windy conditions by allowing wind to pass through the material with less resistance. The canopy material also meets all CPAI-84 fire resistant requirements.</p>\n \n<p>Of all the questions we get on this site, one of the most popular is, &quot;Which tent is easiest to set up and take down?&quot; It&apos;s not a coincidence EZ-Up built their name and reputation on this process. Their instant shelters are always at the top of our list when we answer this question. We found EZ-Up&apos;s proprietary Auto Slider Pull-Pin technology provides a quick lock release with a light tug of the pin. The leg locks come equipped with toggle leg adjustment with 3 height settings. With the push of a button the leg adjusters release allowing for an easy selection of a preferable height option. We found it useful to extend 2 legs half way and the other 2 legs all the way for an angled setting. This configuration is great for providing shade from a sun that is low on the horizon, or to increase stability with the shorter legs facing into the wind. We found the hassle free pinch-less locks to be best in class. No more sore fingers.</p>\n \n<p>Last but definitely not least, let&apos;s talk about how ultra-lightweight this canopy tent is! Weighing in at about 34 lbs., it is 10 lbs. lighter than any other tent on our list. A Wide-Trax Roller Bag is included with the product and the high-density wheels are attached to an oversized axle providing unmatched stability. We can&apos;t emphasize how nicely this bag rolls.

But don&apos;t make the assumption that just because this is a newer brand, their tents are not every bit as robust and convenient as those from more established companies. In fact, we found ABCCanopy easily stands up to some of the of the biggest names in the industry thanks to their commitment in quality craftsmanship, value, reliability, durability and strength. All manufacturing is done in house and is closely monitored with rigorous quality control inspections to ensure that every last detail is exactly the way customers expect, the absolute best.</p>\n \n<p>ABCCanopy offers a massive selection of pop-up canopy tents. Sizes range from 10x10 to 10x20. You can choose steel or aluminum frames, and the color variations available for the canopies are practically endless. But the shelter we want to highlight today, which we found is the best pop up canopy in their lineup, is the 10x10 KingKong series instant shelter. The specs on this thing are hard to believe at a price point we find to be extremely competitive. From the industry leading 26mm x 13mm x 1mm truss bars that weave throughout the top, the 300 denier polyester canopy material that is 100% waterproof, to the smooth and safe thumb lock push button sliders; we are hard pressed to find a better commercial grade instant shelter that delivers more value.</p>\n  \n<p>Over the past few years, we&apos;ve observed more and more canopy tent manufacturers turning to cheap materials to increase their profits margins. But ABCCanopy is turning to high-quality materials, and consumers are taking notice. This is setting the brand up to be a huge success. If you&apos;re into buying a new pop up canopy every year, this isn&apos;t the one for you. With proper care and storage this shelter will last for years of recreational and commercial use. Rarely do we come across a shelter that gives a &apos;wow factor&apos; quite like the King Kong series from ABCCanopy.</p>\n \n<p>You will notice right off the bat that this is a heavy-duty shelter. There is no mistaking the quality of materials used thanks to the 53 lbs of powder coated steel that is used throughout the frame structure. As always, the full cross-truss support will provide unmatched stability and is highly recommended over its pyramid support counterparts. In fact, what initially caught our attention in this King Kong series were images of ABCCanopy employees standing on top of the cross truss frame showing off its strength and durability. We weren&apos;t quite that bold, but we did have two of our team members hang from the center supports and it held up structurally with no issues with the 350 lbs. of force pulling on the steel.</p>\n \n<p>Pretty impressive, right? Obviously, we don&apos;t suggest you try this at home, but you don&apos;t have to—we did it for you! You won&apos;t see the 1 ¼ inch sturdy steel legs folding with pressure, unless under extreme weather conditions. We found the nylon composite brackets at all the joints diffuse pressure on the intersections, which greatly aid in the support system to ensure the joints don&apos;t bend or kink. We especially love the smooth and safe push slider buttons for an easy release of the telescoping legs and top canopy locks. With the quick push of a button, we found ourselves choosing between one of the three leg adjustments and erecting the instant shelter effortlessly with two people. Due to the size and weight, we highly recommend two people assisting in setup and teardown of this canopy tent.</p>\n \n<p>Moving on to the canopy material itself, this is top notch denier polyester. The 300D polyester with a polyurethane lining is one of the best pop up canopy materials on the market today. ABCCanopy claims that this tent is 100% waterproof. Yeah—we didn&apos;t believe it right away either. The majority of instant shelters are water-resistant at best. But we were pleasantly surprised that after having this tent outside during two heavy rain storms, not even a drop of water made it underneath. In addition to the double stitching, the heat sealed seems ensure that absolutely no water will make it through the material.</p>\n \n<p>We love the detail in the reinforced stress points where the peak meets the pole at the very top and where the valance comes over the eaves on the corners. It really shows the commitment to quality in this KingKong series and that no corners were cut (pun intended), which we think will really prolong the life of the canopy. Overall, the waterproofing is perfect for food vendors, outdoor fairs, tailgates, and sporting events since we all know those hot summer days are prone to the quick passing shower. This tent is your insurance policy against light rain, protecting you and your belongings.</p>\n \n<p>Being as this is a heavy-duty shelter, it needs a heavy-duty roller bag. ABCCanopy has included just such a bag with your purchase. The reinforced web handles and two wheels on a solid steel axle make gliding across concrete or firm grass effortless. In addition to the rolling bag, we want to touch on some add-on accesorries that will only enhance your experience with your 10x10 KingKong series tent. We think ABCCanopy manufactures some of the best add-on tent accessories of any brand in this industry. Their 10x10 sun wall panel is a best-selling accessory for any instant shelter thanks to the adjustable Velcro straps that can attach to nearly any square canopy leg, doesn&apos;t matter the brand. The zipper on the panel side allows for multiple sun walls (available as an add-on purchase) to be joined at the corners which we found also helps to stop wind blowing through the shelter. If you are planning to use your tent in windy conditions, you are definitely going to want to make this add-on purchase.</p>\n \n<p>Lastly, the ABCCanopy weight bag set is perhaps the best anchor available today. The 1680 denier polyester material will hold 20-25 pounds of sand, rock or dirt and is perfect for any surface. Many fairs or outdoor markets require vendors to anchor their shelters. Obviously, you cannot use stakes if you are setting up on concrete, so weight bags become a necessity. You&apos;ll be able to rest easy knowing your shelter will not turn into a flying weapon or pose a danger to you or those around you during above average wind gusts.</p>\n \n <p>It is hard to beat the value for this canopy tent. Even at a recreational price point, it boasts commercial-grade quality. The quality is something we surely think you will appreciate for many years to come. We think it could be considered the best 10x10 canopy for any street vendor. However, due to the weight at 53 lbs. it might not be the best option for those of you looking to take shelter to the beach or somewhere that requires carrying it longer distances. We especially love the 30+ color options available so you&apos;ll be sure to find one that you like or match your team colors for your upcoming tailgate. Marry that with a sleek sun wall panel in the same color and you will, without a doubt, make those around you wish they had an ABCCanopy.</p>\n \n <p><strong>Set up :</strong> completed in 6:19 with 1 person, and 3:21 with 2 people</p>\n <p><strong>Teardown :</strong> completed in 4:58 with 1 person, and 2:47 with 2 people</p>','Best Overall',0),(6,2,4,'Coleman','DayTripper Beach Shade','/img/beach-cabana-tent.jpg','The Coleman DayTripper is the most affordable half-dome style beach sun shade on our list, yet maintains the same quality as its more expensive competitors.

It offers many of the same features as more expensive competitors, but at a lesser cost. We think that it is the best beach tent if you are shopping on a budget.</p> <p>The Coleman DayTripper weighs in at about 7.5 pounds, which is reasonable for these types of pop up beach shades. It ships in a rectangular carry bag that measures roughly 7” x 7” x 24”, which is about a foot shorter than most other half-dome beach tents. The travel case has the product information printed on one side, which is typical of products that are sold at major retailers. The product information on the carry bag makes it look a little cheap from the outside, but this is trivial.</p> <p>The Coleman DayTripper is made with surprising quality, considering the price. The fabric is Coleman’s patented UVGuard material, which is a water-resistant and more importantly ultraviolet radiation resistant. Many people use their pop up sun shelters to protect children or pets from the sun, so we take the UPF rating very seriously. The DayTripper has a UPF 50+ rating, which is excellent protection.</p> <p>The anchor points are typical of what we see with many Coleman tents. They double stitch the anchor point to the tent fabric and provide two brass eyeholes. One of the eyeholes is for the stake, and the other is for the tent pole. The stakes that are included with the DayTripper are pretty thin and cheap. They pull out of the sand very easily. If you do wind up purchasing this beach shelter, we would suggest also investing in a set of threaded beach tent stakes like the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2s61Oym\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orange Screw</a>.</p> <p>The Coleman DayTripper has an appealing and pragmatic design. The rear wall is dominated by a large window that includes a screen and UVGuard panel, so you have the option to completely open the window, close just the screen, or shut the window entirely. The window is large enough that you can use it as a rear exit when it is opened. The pop up beach shelter also has a small awning for extra sun protection out front of the main entrance. The sun shelter is 4 foot 9 inches tall. It is about 7.5 feet wide and 4.5 feet deep. It is spacious enough for children to comfortably play inside or for two adults to sit next to each other.</p> <p>The Coleman DayTripper has an attached floor that extends out the front of the covered area so that beach-goers have a nice area in front of the tent that still protects them from the sand. The shape of the ground cloth was cleverly designed so that it can be zipped up to completely enclose the sheltered area. This beach sun shade is the only one on our list that seals for complete privacy. This is nice for when you are at the beach because you can zip up all of your valuables and head down to the water. It also provides the privacy you would need to change clothes or change a baby.</p> <p>Setting up the DayTripper is much like setting up a typical tent. Three fiberglass poles make up the frame of this tent. The only criticism that I have for this beach shade is that setup is a bit old fashioned. I have seen new technology where frames are constructed as once piece, so connecting poles feels outdated. I also like external clips instead of pole sleeves, when they are made the right way. With the DayTripper, users feed the poles through sleeves and insert the tips into the brass eyeholes, like they would set up a traditional camping tent. Setup might take 5 or 7 minutes the first time, but after it is done once it gets quicker and easier.</p> <p>All things considered, the Coleman DayTripper Beach Shade is a great beach sun shelter for the money. It is the cheapest on our list, but is still on par with its more expensive pop up beach shades in terms of quality. It is durable, has a sleek design, is portable, and is affordable. I admit that setup is a bit clunky, but I think that tradeoff is well worth everything else you get with this product. I recommend this pop up sun shelter to anybody that is looking for the best tent at an affordable price.</p>',NULL,NULL),(7,2,1,'Lightspeed Outdoors','Sun Shelter','/img/lightspeed-outdoors-beach-tent.jpg','The Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter is the best beach tent in terms of overall value because it is made with quality materials, it is simple to set up, and it is reasonably priced.','4.8','https://amzn.to/2u7Jkyi','<p>Sometimes it is worth it to spend a little extra money for a quality product.

This color combination, with the white logo, makes the product look stylish. With all of its components, this beach shelter still weighs in under 7.5 lbs so transportation is as easy as throwing it over a shoulder. Product information and easy to follow visual instructions are discreetly printed on the inside of the carry bag, ensuring the product maintains its sleek appearance when packed.</p> <p>The Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter is made out of thick tear-resistant polyester. Seams are doubled stitched and additional trim is sewed along the exposed fabric edges, contributing to a general feeling of high-quality craftsmanship. The material is water resistant and offers an ultraviolet radiation resistance rating of UPF 50+. We place high value on ultraviolet radiation resistance because we know that our readers will place their trust in the products that we vouch for to possibly protect pets or children. Lightspeed Outdoors manufactures their uv beach tents with high quality polyester that we trust and our readers can as well.</p> <p>The Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter has shoulder-height tie-down anchor points along the exterior of the tent. High anchor points offer greater stability in windy situations than floor anchor points. The product ships with 8 thick plastic ribbed stakes that are designed specifically to hold firm in sandy foundations. Some of the other products that we have reviewed ship with thin aluminum stakes that are not suitable for sand use. Improvements like this are what make us so excited about Lightspeed Outdoors. It seems that every time the brand has the choice to cut corners or to put in the extra effort to make their product the best on the market, they choose the latter option.</p> <p>When it is set up, the Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter looks plain cool. I wish there was a more professional way to say it, but I can’t think of a more appropriate description. The tent fabric is attached to the fiberglass frame poles with plastic hooks, which adds to the modern design and makes it easy to disassemble the shelter for cleaning. The tent stands 4 feet 6 inches tall and extends 8 feet wide, which is plenty of room for two adults to sit comfortably inside. The beach sun shade has three large netted windows with panels that can be hooked closed for privacy or protection from the elements. Although window hooks are nice because they allow easy opening and closing of the flaps, my one small critique would be that a zipper might be a better option for two reasons. First of all, if it rains, water seeps through the netting and runs along the inside walls at the base of the windows because the windows aren’t sealed shut. Most vacationers will not be using their pop up sun shelter in the rain so this critique is probably irrelevant. The other reason is that when I was inside the pop up beach shade, with the windows closed I could still see outside if I put my eyes right up against the wall of the shelter at a sharp angle. If somebody needs complete privacy inside the shelter, this could lead to a feeling of vulnerability even though privacy is pretty much guaranteed. I will admit that the hooks are much quicker and easier to use than a zipper would have been, though.</p> <p>The beach sun shade has an oversized attached floor that serves dual purposes. The first, and more obvious reason is that it provides protection from the sand. The floor extends past the sheltered footprint of the beach tent, which allows the user to lay fully outstretched without touching the sand. The oversized floor facilitates the second purpose that the floor serves, which is that it also can fold up and attach to the ceiling. When it is folded up, the floor creates a barrier that completely seals in the sheltered area for privacy.</p> <p>The Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter is the easiest to set up out of all of the shade tents that we have reviewed so far. Once the beach shade tent is removed from the carry bag and unbuckled, the legs naturally fall open. To set it up, all the user has to do is grab the center support with one hand and tug the pull-cord with the other hand. This action extends the frame and erects the beach tent. The whole process takes less than 30 seconds. The innovative frame design is a game changer in our opinion. Now that we have seen how easy it can be to set up a pop up sun shelter, we never want to go back to the old process. Tear down is as easy as setup. By separating the connection fitting in the center of the frame, the entire frame looses its structure and collapses like folding up an umbrella.</p> <p>We were thoroughly impressed with the Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter and stand by our statement that it is the best tent on the market in terms of value. The product is made with high quality and attention to detail. The innovative frame design makes setup and tear down easier than any beach tent we have seen so far. It has a sleek modern design that really catches the eye, and has the ability to provide complete privacy. We recommend this product for anybody who is looking for the newest sun tent technology at a reasonable price.</p>',NULL,NULL),(8,2,3,'Pacific Breeze','Sand & Surf Beach Shelter','/img/beach-sun-shade.jpg','The Pacific Breeze Sand and Surf Shelter is the best full-overhead coverage beach sun shelter on the market. It is functional, affordable, and perfect for anybody looking for a little more shade than the half-dome style sun shelters can provide.','4.3','https://amzn.to/2uEhlpl','<p>All of the other product on our Top-5 beach tent list share a common shortcoming. They all lack full overhead coverage. In many situations partial coverage is sufficient. But sometimes it is nice to be able to sit back in complete shade. Some people cannot tolerate prolonged direct sunlight so shade isn’t just a convenience; it’s a necessity. The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is our pick for the best beach tent with full-overhead coverage. It is lightweight, easy to setup, and provides 360 degree UV protection at an affordable price.</p> <p>The beach shelter weighs right around 9 pounds, which is impressive considering the extra fabric needed for its full overhead design. It collapses and packs into a 30 x 7 x 7 inch carry bag that is easily thrown over a shoulder for transportation. The product that we reviewed was sea-foam blue with a white label and black strap. The color combination is pleasant and gives off beach vibes. Our one critique to the carry bag is that the strap is attached to the carry bag with a single stitch, which could potentially fail if it is abused.</p> <p>The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is made with lightweight polyester. Seams are double stitched and the edges of the fabric are reinforced with additional polyester trim. The polyester is water resistant and ultra violet radiation resistant. The fabric is rated UPF 50+, which means that it will block 98% of ultra violet rays. This is an excellent rating. We believe that the consumers in the market for a full overhead pop up beach shade value protection from the sun, which is why we won’t even review a full overhead beach shade that doesn’t provide the highest UV protection.</p> <p>This pop up sun shelter ships with thick plastic stakes that are perfect for the beach. Most of the aluminum frame pop-up canopy tents that we review ship with thin metal stakes that easily pull out of the sand. Beach-goers need to purchase additional stakes if they plan to use these canopy tents at the beach, so we see quantifiable monetary value in including the right kind of stakes. In addition to being able to stake the corners of the floor down, the Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter also has built in anchor points on the sides of the beach shade tent. These shoulder-height tie downs provide extra stability for windy days on the beach. High anchor points won’t just keep the pop up beach shade secure, they will also protect it from becoming damaged because the pressure from the wind will be distributed more evenly.</p> <p>The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter looks like it belongs on the beach. The light blue and grey color combination looks great against a sandy backdrop. This product has an external fiberglass frame, which is connected to the fabric with plastic hooks. This makes it easy to separate the tent fabric from the frame and is convenient for cleaning. The pop up sun shelter stands right around 5 feet tall and provides shade for a 94 x 94 inch footprint. This is the perfect sized beach sun shade. It’s big enough to allow a few people to sit comfortably underneath, but not so big that it is difficult to find an adequate plot of real estate on a crowded beach. The pop up beach shade includes a removable sun wall that can be moved to exposed sides to ensure shade as the sun rotates across the sky. The sun shelter is constructed of lightweight polyester so that it remains light enough to comfortably carry over a shoulder. My one small critique of this pop up beach shade is that the lighter weight polyester may be more susceptible to tearing than some of the smaller half-dome variations that are able to use thicker material. That being said, if Pacific Breeze used heavier grade polyester then the tent would most likely be too heavy to be conveniently transported. I was able to ride to the beach on a bicycle with this sun shade tent strapped diagonally over my shoulder, which was nice. The lightweight polyester is still strong enough to withstand normal wear and tear without ripping, so this shouldn’t be an issue if this sun shelter will be used primarily in low impact weather.</p> <p>The pop up sun shelter includes a heavy-duty polyethylene floor, which provides protection from sand and water. The floor is permanently attached to the corners of the sun tent because it provides tension necessary to keep the structure standing. Pacific Breeze included a zipper along the edges of the floor that allows the center of the fabric to be detached and rolled. This feature provides users with the ability to lie directly in the sand, if they wish to.</p> <p>The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter ships completely assembled and is easy to setup. Whenever the polyester strap, that holds the shelter wrapped, is removed the legs fall open. The legs are folded in half at pivot joints so the user unfolds them and raises the central frame hub above his or her head. A pull cord that hangs from the central hub can be pulled to expand the entire frame. Setup takes around a minute. It is always smart to stake down a beach tent, but the shelter stands freely without needing to be staked down. Teardown is just as easy. When two bars near the top of the frame are pressed inward, the whole shelter collapses. Then the legs are folded back inwards and the fabric is rolled around the collapsed frame. Teardown only takes a minute or two.</p> <p>We are big fans of the Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter because it provides complete overhead coverage. There are many people that are less tolerant of direct sunlight and require shade to escape potentially harmful rays. For these people, full coverage is a necessity. There are also people who just prefer the ability to relax in complete shade. Whether it is a necessity or preference, we believe that the Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Shelter is the best option because it is functional and affordable. Our only critique of this beach sun shelter is that the lightweight polyester may be susceptible to tearing, but considering the price and the features it provides, we believe it is the full overhead coverage best beach tent on the market.</p>',NULL,NULL),(9,2,2,'Easthills Outdoors','Easy Up Beach Tent','/img/beach-sun-shelter.jpg','The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent is the lightest weight and most portable pop up beach shade on our list. It has a smart design that maximizes portability, while not sacrificing quality. Arms are usually full when people are walking to the beach, so we value its lightweight architecture.','4.5','https://amzn.to/2uFhEje','<p>The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent separates itself from competing brands by being the lightest weight and most portable tent available. By using ultra lightweight polyester and an efficient design, Easthills Outdoors is able to manufacture the most convenient, and arguably, the best beach tent on the market. The brand is able to maximize portability, while not sacrificing quality, by reinforcing areas of the shelter that receive the most stress like seams and anchor points. There is a difference between being \"lightweight\" and being \"cheap\" and the Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent is a prime example of this.</p> <p>The beach shelter ships in a 39 x 8 inch polyester carry bag. The carry bag is the highest quality bag that we have seen. It has two hand straps that loop under the bag and are connected, so there isn’t any possibility that the straps will rip from the bag material at weak seams. There is also a third full length strap which provides the option to transport the beach sun shade over a shoulder. The carry bag has a full length zipper instead of a drawstring at one end, which we typically see in these types of beach tents. We like that Easthills Outdoors puts the same attention to detail into peripheral accessories as they put into the tent, itself. The extra effort in the construction of the carry bag contributes to an overall sense of quality for the product as a whole.</p> <p>The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent is constructed out of ultra lightweight polyester. The fabric is rated 185T (thread count), which in itself would not be dense enough to provide sufficient protection. Instead of increasing the thread count, which would add weight, Easthills Outdoors sealed the material with an impermeable chemical that provides water resistance, and more importantly ultraviolet radiation resistance. Many backpacking tent manufacturers use this same process. The beach sun shade is rated UPF 50+, which means that it will block at least 98% of UV rays. This is an excellent rating. The shelter weighs in at 6.2 lbs, which is more than a pound lighter than the next lightest shelter on our list.</p> <p>The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent has four anchor points along the corners of the floor of the canopy and includes two guy lines to tie down the shelter from waist-high anchor points. This makes sure that tension is evenly distributed during windy situations. The stake and guy line anchor points are nylon loops firmly stitched into the corner seams of the tent. With thinner fabric, there runs a higher risk of tearing. Tearing usually occurs at seams and anchor points so we like to see Easthills Outdoors putting additional reinforcement into these vulnerable areas. The nylon anchor loops are a different color than the rest of the beach shade, which adds pleasant color contrast and contributes to a sleek modern design. The included stakes are thick plastic and ribbed, and are specifically designed for sandy foundations. The shelter also has pockets which can be filled with sand to add additional weight to keep the shelter from blowing away.</p> <p>The fabric attaches to the frame with a combination of sleeves and plastic hooks. The top shades have sleeves instead of hooks. Sleeves are better for durability because they distribute tension evenly along the entire sleeve instead of isolating all of the stress at the points where the hooks are attached to the fabric. The drawback to sleeves is that they are slightly less convenient for detaching the fabric from the frame, but for as infrequent as we expect our readers to need to do this, we think that sleeves are better because durability is more important than ease of frame detachment. The pop up sun shade stands 4 feet tall and measures just under 7 feet wide. It is slightly smaller than some of the other half-dome shelters we have reviewed, but the change in size is hardly noticeable and not a detriment. In fact, some people prefer a smaller beach shade tent, especially if they plan on using it on a crowded beach. The shelter has three panels that can be rolled up and hooked to expose netted windows. Hooks are great for convenience because it is quick and easy to roll the windows up and hook them open, but the drawback is that they do not provide a seal like a zipper would. That means that if it rains, it is possible that water could drip through the bottoms of the windows. This critique may be irrelevant because most vacationers don’t go out to the beach on rainy days.</p> <p>The floor of the shade tent is made from durable 120g Polyethylene material that provides ground protection from sand and water. The floor extends out front of the covered area of the sun shelter, providing a nice patio area to lay on. The oversized floor serves a second purpose, as well. The patio portion of the floor can be folded up and zipped around the edges of the entrance of the beach tent. This allows the user to completely seal the inside area. This feature is valuable for two reasons. First of all, it provides complete privacy which is nice if beach-goers need to change out of a wet bathing suit or change a baby. It also allows the user to put a small lock where the zippers meet, which allows beach-goers to head down to the water and not worry that their valuables are going to be stolen. The privacy wall is a common feature with half-dome beach tents, but the Easthills Outdoors is the only sun tent on our list that has dual zippers and the ability to be completely sealed and locked. We think this is a valuable feature that separates this product from competitors.</p> <p>The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach tent is very easy to set up. The sleeves do not add any inconvenience to the setup process because the frame remains fixed to the fabric at all times. That means that there isn’t any time during setup or teardown where the user is sliding tent poles through the sleeves. Whenever the tent is removed from the carry bag and the polyethylene strap is untied, the frame falls open. To set up the tent, the user lifts the frame to eye height by two pull cords that extend from the top of the central frame hub. When these two cords are pulled in opposite directions, the frame expands and the joints lock into an erect position. That’s all there is to it. The whole process takes less than 30 seconds and the beach tent is ready to be set up right out of the box.</p> <p>The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent has found a market niche and is dominating it. It is the option for somebody who values portability. It is the lightest weight shelter and is perfect for vacationers who already have a heavy beach load and don’t want to add any unnecessary weight. Easthills Outdoors is able to maximize portability, while maintaining quality, by using ultralight polyester and reinforcing vulnerable seams with extra stitching and nylon straps. Despite its lightweight materials, the sun shade tent is surprisingly strong and deserves to be in the conversation as one of the best beach tents on the market.</p>',NULL,NULL),(10,2,5,'Sport-Brella','Portable Sun and Weather Shelter','/img/pop-up-sun-shelter.jpg','The Sport-Brealla is on our list because it is the easiest pop up sun shelter to set up and it is the least expensive. Setup is as easy as opening an umbrella. Its unique umbrella-like design is functional for beach use. The Sport-Brella is perfect for somebody looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use product that works.','3.9','https://amzn.to/2tbcSKC','<p>Even though the Sport-Brella doesn’t follow the design trend of traditional beach sun shelters, it still accomplishes the same goal, which is to provide shade at the beach. This product is completely different than any other pop up sun shelter that we have reviewed, but in a good way. It is refreshing to see something different, and the umbrella design has enough benefits that we think this product is possibly the best shade on the market.</p> <p>The Sport-Brella is part of a line of various sized umbrella style beach shelters. The product we reviewed is advertised as having a 96 inch width, but when we sat inside of it we found that it actually had about 6.5 feet of usable space. Since the umbrella leans at an angle, in order to provide shade, the height of the shelter winds up measuring around 4.5 feet. These dimensions are fine for an average height person sitting on a typical beach chair. One of the people on the review team is 6’1” and sat comfortably under the Sport-Brella in a folding chair. For vacationers that are any taller than this, or will be using an abnormally high beach chair, then it might make sense to go with the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2sbuh0L\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sport-Brella XL</a>, which has an additional foot of clearance.</p> <p>The Sport-Brella weighs 9 lbs and ships in a 54” sleeve. The fabric feels durable. It is made with 210D polyester, which will provide water resistance and UPF 50+ ultraviolet radiation protection. Ultraviolet radiation protection is something that we value very highly so we like the fact that the fabric will block over 98% of ultraviolet rays. This is considered excellent protection. The 210D fabric rating means that the canopy has a thread count of 210 denier, which is considered good quality fabric. The canopy has two windows that unzip, exposing a mesh net barrier. The panel that covers the windows is also water resistant.</p> <p>This is the easiest beach sun shade, out of all that we have reviewed, to set up and tear down. Even though some of the half-dome pop up sun shelters that we reviewed have sophisticated pull-cord mechanisms, nothing is as easy as the Sport-Brella because setting it up is literally as easy as opening an umbrella. Beach-goers set up the Sport-Brella the same way they would open a rain umbrella. There is a slider along the center pole that pushes upwards, which opens the canopy. Next the umbrella is laid on its side and a telescoping pole is extended until the umbrella rests at a comfortable angle. Finally, the sidewalls and the two rear anchor points are staked down. Like some of the other beach shelters that we have reviewed, the stakes that are included are not suitable for the beach. If the wind picks up, these thin stakes will easily pull out of dry sand. We recommend investing in a set of stakes that are specifically designed for use in the sand like the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2s61Oym\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orange Screw</a>.</p> <p>The Sport-Brella umbrella design has some interesting advantages that make it more versatile than the other pop up sun shelters on this list. Because it has a center pole, there is an option of setting it up like a picnic umbrella. In this setup configuration, the center pole stands vertically with the umbrella off the ground overhead. Evenly distributed tie downs are used to keep the umbrella standing vertically. The other option is to use this beach sun shade as an actual umbrella. The Sport-Brella is much larger than a typical umbrella, but it can be held above the head and used like a traditional umbrella.</p> <p>We think that the Sport-Brella is one of the best beach tents on the market due to its versatile design and ease of use. We do have some critiques, though. We don’t think its quality is as high as the other products above it. If this sun shelter is used in high winds, it runs the risk of becoming damaged. The anchor points are sufficient for recreational use, but will tear if they are exposed to high stress. Also, the angle of the umbrella is pretty extreme when set up, so it is unable to provide as much shelter as a half-dome pop up beach shade would be able to provide.</p> <p>Despite our criticism, it is important to remember that this pop up beach shelter is the most affordable option. Vacationers who use the Sport-Brella for typical beach days are going to be happy with its performance and can plan on continuing to use it for many seasons. We never like to encourage our readers to spend extra money unnecessarily, which is why we are recommending this shelter. It will get the job done for a very reasonable price. Out of all of the options in this price range, the Sport-Brella is the best beach tent.</p>',NULL,NULL),(11,3,1,'Pacific Breeze','Sand & Surf Beach Shelter','/img/baby-pop-up-tent.jpg','The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Beach Shelter is the best full-overhead coverage kids beach tent on the market. Its overhead canopy design is advantageous if you need a larger protected area. If you have multiple or taller children, this tent is probably your best option.','4.6','https://amzn.to/2uEhlpl','<p>The Pacific Breeze Sand & Surf Beach Shelter was a no brainer when our team set out to find the best baby beach tent. Pacific Breeze is a company well known for manufacturing some of the highest quality beach shelters on the market today. As always, the first criterion for parents in search of a UV tent for a baby is the use of 50+ UPF in the canopy material, which this baby sun shade achieves through the use of lightweight polyester. What initially caught our eye was the open-air concept of this shelter. Unlike the common and popular half dome shelter, this canopy gives beach lovers the option of having 3 of the 4 sides completely open while offering full overhead protection. Even the best ventilated half dome shelters with 3 windows can still become overheated on a hot summer day. Having the open sides can provide a much-needed breeze to keep those napping babies asleep. In addition to the unmatched air circulation and ventilation this offers, the ability to have 180 degrees of unobstructed panoramic beach views is something that our team absolutely loves and any parent will appreciate as their child begins to wander down the shoreline. Along with the unhindered views, the biggest selling point is the actual size of this shelter. Pacific Breeze makes two XL shelters; this one, and the Easy Up Beach Tent Deluxe XL. Because of the square design of this shelter, it provides 62 square feet of floor space compared to the roughly 28 square feet of floor space the Deluxe XL offers. We love the Deluxe XL, but the size of the Sand & Surf Shelter is unmatched. For a family of 4 or 5 with a baby or toddler in tow, we highly recommend this tent.</p> <p>When our pop up shelter first arrived, it felt slightly heavier than most of the other products we have reviewed. After removing it from the packaging, the tent weighed in at just over 9 lbs. which is heavier than the average 7 lbs. of most half dome baby pop up tents. This is a direct result of the increased amount of polyethylene tarp material used in the flooring. Although the tent is significantly larger than most, it packs into a carrying tote bag that is of similar size to the industry standard of 38 x 7 x 7 inches which is a credit to the engineering team. All the top baby tents come equipped with a central compression hub system. This allows the fiberglass rods to come fully integrated throughout the canopy and also allows for quick and easy setup, perfect for any parent with mobile children. The most common compression systems are top-pull and side-pull hubs, but the Sand & Surf Shelter comes equipped with a bottom pull hub which we actually found the be the most difficult of any to setup. Some might find the requirement to crawl underneath the canopy to lift the compression upwards more difficult than they had hoped. However, it is still very easy for one person to accomplish, and the tent immediately pops open in seconds. Conversely, teardown is very simple and very fast. We completed it in less than 45 seconds as the entire shelter folds together easily and securely fit inside the carrying tote.</p> <p>As mentioned, our favorite feature of this baby sun shade tent is the ability to fit the entire family in a shaded area that prevents being exposed to those harmful UV rays. The large square footage is something you won’t find in any other UV tent for a baby. It will comfortably house 2 adults and 3 children. It is the perfect size to set up a small inflatable infant pool underneath, and we think your child will really appreciate that option on a hot summer day. Second to that, the ability to unzip the floor to allow a baby or toddler to play in the sand while still being in the shade is something that our team found to be incredibly thoughtful. In addition, the option for parents put their feet and chairs in the sand and still be in the shade is something we also think you will greatly appreciate. Or keep the floor zipped for a less sandy baby or have a lunchtime picnic with the family without exposing food and blankets to the sand.</p> <p>Another great feature parents will really enjoy is the removable sunwall, or what Pacific Breeze refers to as the attachable shadow. The sunwall comes included with the purchase, and increases the functionality of the tent as it blocks UV rays when the sun begins to get lower in the horizon. It attaches to any side of the beach tent via toggles, and we found it to be a great feature to get extra shade without having to move the shelter as the sun moves throughout the day. And if it’s a hot day, remove the panel to allow for maximum ventilation. Another thoughtful feature that parents will surely appreciate are the internal pockets that are located toward the top of the canopy, conveniently located out of reach from those cell phone seeking children.</p> <p>Overall, this X-Large baby sun shade tent is the perfect option for the entire family to keep cool on a hot day at the shore. The ability for a child to play in the sand, or nap on the flooring, all while still being protected from the sun with the best UV material is a top-notch idea. Its good value for the money, looks great, and is top class in every respect. It’s the best baby beach tent, hands down.</p>',NULL,NULL),(12,3,2,'Easthills Outdoors','Easy Up Beach Tent','/img/baby-sun-tent.jpg','The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent is arguably the best baby beach tent on our list. It is intelligently designed to maximize portability, while not sacrificing quality. It has a stylish appearance and a sturdy frame. It has all the right qualities that you want to see in the best baby beach shades.','4.5','https://amzn.to/2uFhEje','<p>The Easthills Outdoors Easy Up Beach Tent Sun Shelter is an excellent option for any family with a baby or toddler in tow. Easthills Outdoors is a small company that was born out of necessity of the founders, because a few guys realized the quality gear they desired for their outdoor adventures just didn’t exist. After reading thousands of customer reviews, talking to and listening to beach lovers all over the world, Easthills created a shelter that would catapult them into instant pop up sun shelter fame. Since then they have fine-tuned manufacturing and this Easy Up Beach Tent Sun Shelter is the culmination of everything they have learned over the years. It rightly could be considered the best UV tent for a baby on the market today thanks to the 50+ UPF lightweight canopy material, excellent ventilation, and extended front porch capable of zipping up for added privacy. But what really sets this tent apart is the overall value it offers in terms of quality to price. Let’s take a closer look at the specifications and how they stack up against the others.</p> <p>The first thing we noticed when our tent arrived was how lightweight the packaging was. The entire package, shipping box included, was just over 6 lbs. We opened it almost expecting they forgot to put the shelter in the box. Fortunately, this was not the case and the tent was securely packed the carrying tote that comes with purchase. The tent itself weighs just over 4 lbs., which very easily makes it the lightest compression hub tent we have reviewed thus far. For parents with small children, portability is a top criterion next to sun protection and this is as easily transportable as they come. Crafted from ultra-lightweight 185T polyester coated with UPF 50+ for the best sun protection there is, we’ve been hard pressed to find a better material for baby sun shade. A trip to the beach with children often includes both hands filled with bags, coolers, toys, chairs, and towels. The carrying tote is easy to sling over a shoulder and has compact dimensions of 42 x 7 inches. This will come in handy when your children are a little older and capable of lending a helping hand. Some might find that the initial set up is a little more difficult than expected. It took us roughly 3 minutes from the time we removed the bag until it was fully set up for the very first time however it has gotten much easier with each use and now takes roughly 30 seconds each time we set it up. We attributed this to the poles having never been flexed into their fixed position yet so it took some massaging initially until the fiberglass poles became worked and the tent knew how to ‘fall’. Setup is as easy as standing over the top of the tent, and with two hands pulling the drawstrings on the hub mechanism upward and out until the lower and upper hubs snap into place. The integrated fiberglass rods flex into place and the tent takes shape. Again, this first time will be the most difficult but it will get much easier with each use. Teardown is just as simple. Located on the rods just underneath the hub system are two red stickers that read ‘PUSH’. Oddly enough, pushing on these rods with a little bit of pressure will collapse the tent with ease.</p> <p>This specific shelter is a top baby beach tent contender because of the features that make life easier for any parent of an infant or toddler. The majority of tents in the mid-size (2 adults) sun shelters only offer 1 or 2 mesh windows. Of all the pop up sun shelters that we have reviewed over the years, we haven’t been able to figure out why all shelters do not include the 3 side mesh windows which allow for a panoramic view and maximum circulation. Never once have we talked to a beach lover that said ‘I wish my tent had fewer windows’. Toddlers and especially infants are prone to overheating quicker than adults so allowing air to pass through the tent on a hot day is absolutely critical. One window might not allow adequate circulation, but having 3 windows allows a breeze to penetrate the shelter from any direction. We found the external sand pockets to be very helpful during our time at the beach with slight wind gusts. The included guy lines are helpful in most windy conditions but we found the stakes have some difficulty securely staying in loose sand. However with 10 stakes included, it provides more than enough support in case a few become unlogged in the sand. Our favorite attribute of this shelter, one that makes it a great option for families with babies; the extended zippered front porch that can be used for changing a baby, breastfeeding, or protecting a napping infant from sand and wind. This might be our favorite tent with a closeable front porch because the use of a zipper as opposed to clips, and the full coverage of the open facing front it protects. We found it useful for those times away from the tent, whether it is a long walk on the beach or a trip back to the house. Easily zip all belongings inside the tent and there is no need to worry about anything being exposed to people passing by. It can also be zipped half way to create the perfect play pen for those toddlers that are becoming more mobile. The material of the porch is a 120 gram polyethylene tarp material which we found to be of great quality. The seams that meet the tent are well stitched and we think it will last many summers of heavy use and harsh sandy conditions.</p> <p>Overall, it’s hard to pick against this tent for the top spot in our search for the best baby beach tent. We think it provides the some of the best value as it is constructed with high quality materials and is one of the most portable and affordable pop up sun shelters on the market. We highly recommend this tent for any family with a toddler.</p>',NULL,NULL),(13,3,3,'WolfWise','Easy Pop Up Beach Tent Baby Canopy','/img/uv-tent-for-baby.jpg','The WolfWise Baby Canopy is the best internal flex-frame beach tent that we have reviwed. Internal frame baby sun tents have advantages such as simple setup and not having loose parts. So we are excited to have finally found one that we like enough to include on our list of best baby beach tents.','4.3','https://amzn.to/2CYK0q0','<p>Baby pop up tents fall into one of two major design categories. Most of the products that we recommend are in the external frame category. These products have tent poles permanently connected to each other with fixed joints. Whenever you pull on the drawstrings, the frame expands and the  shelter pops open. The other common beach tent design has internal flex frames. Flex frame tents can be twisted and folded without breaking any tent poles. This allows manufacturers to construct the tent and frame as a single component, which leads to many advantages. Many of the baby beach tents we recommend are from the first category because we like to recommend pop up tents that are dynamic enough to continue to be used after your baby grows. Flex framed sun tents tend to be smaller and made with lesser quality than external framed sun tents. So, we usually don’t recommend them. But one flex framed UV tent for a baby deviated from this norm and impressed us during testing. The WolfWise Easy Pop Up sun tent is the best flex framed baby sun tent on the market. Flex framed tents offer many benefits. We have been discouraged because we haven’t been able to find one that we think offers enough value to break into our top baby tent collection. We were thrilled when we finally stumbled upon the WolfWise Easy Pop Up beach shade because it is built with high quality materials that we think will be able to withstand years of abuse without failure, and is also large enough that it is able to be used by adults as well as children. The WolfWise Easy Pop Up sun shade is not a toy, or constructed of cheap material like many true baby beach tents seem to be. It is a high-quality sun shelter and is one of the best baby shelters available today.</p> <p>The WolfWise Easy Pop Up UV tent for a baby does not have an external frame. Instead, it has a set of malleable fiberglass internal support structures that expand outwards, giving the shelter its form. Since its internal support is flexible, it is almost impossible to break. In order to break the internal frame, you would have to make an effort to intentionally fold a beam in half. However, even when we tried this the frame just creased and didn’t actually crack. The flexibility of the WolfWise’s frame makes it the most wind resistant baby sun tent on our list. We aimed an industrial fan at ours and the shelter misshaped and bent, as expected. But as soon as we turned off the fan, it popped right back up to its original form. If you are concerned with your frame poles cracking or joints failing on a windy beach, this product might be your best option.</p> <p>Another benefit of a completely internal frame is that there is no risk of losing any pieces. All of the components are self-contained and encompassed inside the fabric, so there isn’t any way to lose a piece in the sand. This is also a great feature many people overlook with a flex frame beach tent. We found the inability for sand to penetrate the joints and cause friction or rubbing at their most vulnerable points, like you might find with external frame shelters, will greatly increase the longevity of the product.</p> <p>We found setup to be a breeze, and actually enjoyable. To pack the tent away, you fold it in a way that the internal frame is restricted from expanding. The frame wants to spring open, but it is constrained because of the way that it is folded into itself. To set up the tent, all you need to do is allow the internal frame to expand naturally. By twisting the collapsed tent, you free the frame to expand and it opens by itself in less than a second. The easy setup is convenient for parents. You know that whenever you get to the beach, your toddler is going to want to start exploring immediately. The last thing you want to have to worry about is corralling your child while you attempt to set up a clunky tent frame. Once the WolfWise Easy Pop Up shade is set up, you can tie it down with the included stakes and pre-attached guy lines, ensuring that your baby pop up tent will remain secure if an unexpected sea breeze blows in. It also has weight pockets along the bottom edge of the floor. You can fill these pockets with sand, which weighs down the tent, adding additional protection from wind.</p> <p>Tear down is just as simple. After you remove the stakes and the sand from the pockets, you lift the shade and twist the top and bottom in opposite directions. This might be difficult and confusing initially, as it feels unnatural to be twisting the frame in the opposite directions. It took us a few attempts to feel comfortable with the process, and now it’s incredibly easy. Twisting in opposite directions will cause the frame to collapse and roll. When it is packed it retains the shape of a disk about 2 feet wide and 2 inches thick. In its packed state it is easy to transport, which is important when you have a baby and your arms are already filled with baby products. The tent weighs about 3 pounds, which is the lightest baby pop up tent on our list and barely noticeable when you have it slung over your shoulder.</p> <p>The biggest reason that many parents purchase a UV tent for baby is because they want to protect their baby from harmful ultraviolet radiation. It is important to look at the ratings of the fabric of the product that you are interested in. To us, this is the most important characteristic of a baby sun tent and we only recommend ones with the highest possible rating. The WolfWise Easy Pop Up tent is no exception to that statement. It is constructed with 190-T durable polyester which is rated UPF 50+. This is the highest possible ultraviolet protection factor and signifies that the fabric will block at least 98% of the UV rays that come into contact with the fabric. Sunburn is not a matter to take lightly. If you do decide to explore beach tents outside of our list, make sure you are satisfied with their UPF rating.</p> <p>The WolfWise Easy Pop Up canopy is the best value internal flex frame beach tent and, in our opinion, is one of the best sun tents on the market. Most internal flex frame tents are small and will not be usable in a few years when your baby outgrows it. But the WolfWise Easy Pop Up shelter will provide value to owners of all ages. It is virtually indestructible so you will never have to worry about it breaking, no matter how much abuse it receives. Since all of the pieces are self-contained you won’t ever have to worry about losing any parts. Its thick durable fabric provides the highest level of sun protection so you can rest assured that whoever is sitting under it will remain completely protected from harmful UV rays. If you are looking for one of the easiest worry-free beach tents on the market, we recommend that you take a serious look at the WolfWise Easy Pop Up beach tent.</p>',NULL,NULL),(14,3,4,'Lightspeed Outdoors','Sun Shelter','/img/pop-up-baby-beach-tent.jpg','The Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter is made with noticable attention to detail and quality components. It has the thickest fabric of all of the products on our list, making it the most durable and resistant to tearing. If you are looking for the strongest baby tent on the market, this might be your best option.','4.3','https://amzn.to/2u7Jkyi','<p>Lightspeed Outdoors impresses again with what might be the best baby beach tent on the market today. In 7 short years, Lightspeed Outdoors has grown from a small brand to one of the biggest players in instant setup gear. From leisurely family beach trips to outdoor camping and hiking excursions, their products have become the go-to option for those looking for the highest quality equipment. We have reviewed a number of products from this company during our search for a baby pop up tent, and every one of them has far surpassed our expectations. But none more so than the Lightspeed Outdoors Sun Shelter with Clip-Up Privacy Feature. A useful combination of lightweight and spacious, this sun shelter provides some of largest shaded square footage at a very reasonable price. It provides similar dimensions and square footage as the XL shelters without the price tag, which any budgeting mom or dad will appreciate. Our team especially loved the clip up privacy feature; which will come in handy for those changing a diaper, nursing a baby, keeping a toddler asleep, or closing up belongings for a trip back to the beach house during lunch. This privacy feature alone can make any pop up beach shelter better suited for baby sun shade. But this UV tent for a baby packs more features than just a fold up porch so let’s take a look at what makes it one of the best.</p>\n<p>At a weight of just 7 lbs., this shelter is on the lighter side in comparison to other canopies with similar dimensions. This is largely a result of the lightweight 8.5mm fiberglass poles integrated throughout the canopy top and the breathable polyurethane water-resistant canopy. The canopy arrived in a carrying tote with dimensions of 43 x 5 inches which is slightly longer than the average carrying tote, but does not impact portability in the least. Upon opening the shelter for the first time, we quickly understood why Lightspeed Outdoors chose a side-pull compression hub system. With a similar motion to that of a bow and arrow, we placed one hand on the hub and pulled the drawstring back with the other hand. It was arguably the easiest baby beach tent setup we’ve seen while testing, and took less than 30 seconds from removing from the tote until fully setup. When it was time to teardown, the process was nearly as simple, taking less than 1 minute to fully pack into the tote. We love that there is a buckle clip included to keep the pop up rolled up in the carrying bag for easy packing. This convenience is something we think every parent will surely love.</p>\n<p>As for the features that make this a top baby pop up tent, we think it starts with the clip up front porch for privacy. The polyester oxford porch is high quality that we think will withstand repeated use and abuse from tough beach conditions for years to come. We’re beginning to see more and more manufacturers incorporate this feature into their sun shelters because of the versatility it adds. Beach lovers, especially those with small children, have found it very useful in any situation that requires more privacy. We would prefer if the porch used a zipper instead of the clip toggles as we have found a zipper to be easier to use and less prone to tearing, however the clips are a high quality stitch and we think will fare just fine with repeated use. A crowded beach in the summer time often requires families to be in close quarters with their neighbors and privacy can be a premium. Breastfeeding without overheating is a tough task without proper ventilation. The capability to clip up the privacy wall, yet still have 3 oversized windows that allow for air circulation is a feature all nursing moms will love. We found that we could easily close the windows on those cool windy days or when privacy is needed, or easily open to allow maximum air flow on hot days. This ability to control temperature under the canopy is a great feature for a baby beach tent.</p>\n<p>When we put this baby pop up tent through our review, it was a day with sustained winds of about 15 mph and this shelter handled the gusts exceptionally well. The fiberglass rods flexed and bowed but didn’t break or collapse at any joint. We did use the provided 8 stakes attached to guylines and looped through the canopy material to help keep the shelter securely on the ground. We also filled the sand bags that attach to the bottom of the tent floors which we found helped significantly. Even in very windy conditions, this shelter would certainly not tumble down the beach like a 10x10 pop up canopy might.</p>\n<p>Overall, LightSpeed Outdoors hit the nail on the head. Our team especially loves the how easy it is to setup and take down while at the shore. The convenience and portability will not be overlooked by busy mom and dad’s traveling to the beach for their summer vacation. A big shelter, with big windows, and a big clip up privacy wall; if you’re looking for an exceptional sun shelter for your family look no further.</p>',NULL,NULL),(15,3,5,'Pacific Breeze','Easy Up Beach Tent','/img/kids-beach-tent.jpg','Pacific Breeze has figured out the equation for balancing affordability with quality. Their Easy Up Beach Tent is the least expensive product on our list. We love that they chose simplicity as a means to cut costs, allowing them to produce an infant beach tent that gets the job done while maintaining a competitive price tag.','4.1','https://amzn.to/2BXm5uh','<p>Pacific Breeze is the highest selling beach tent brand on the market for a reason. They are able to build excellent products at competitive prices. Their Easy Up pop up tent is a prime example of this statement. It is the top selling baby pop up tent on Amazon because it is made with high quality yet maintains an affordable price tag. We chose to put this on out best baby beach tent list because it is one of the lightest external-frame tent that we have reviewed. Portability is a valuable characteristic for parents who have to transport a large bag of baby products in addition to their beach shelter. Since this is the most portable baby pop up tent on the market, we believe that it will appeal to a wide range of consumers. The Pacific Breeze Easy Up pop up tent is one of the lowest priced sun tents available, adding to its popularity. The brand sacrificed non-essential bulky features to reduce weight and costs. By using fewer materials, Pacific Breeze is able to reduce production costs and sell their products at a low price while not sacrificing quality. We love the fact that Pacific Breeze designed a pragmatic bare-bones model as a means of cost cutting, rather than use cheap parts like we see some other manufacturers do. We are big fans of the Pacific Breeze Easy Up sun tent because of its simple effective design and proven performance.  Based on our findings during the testing and review of this tent, we believe the Pacific Breeze Easy Up is built for the long haul.</p> <p>It is often difficult to find a parking spot close to the beach. So, it is important that you are able to carry all of your beach and baby gear in one trip. The Pacific Breeze Easy Up shade shelter weighs less than 4.5 pounds, making it one of the lightest external frame baby sun tent that we have reviewed. To help put that into perspective, most sun shades weigh 7-8 pounds. It collapses and packs into a carry bag similar to the size of a camp chair’s carry bag, which makes it easy to throw over a shoulder for transport. When you’re walking to the beach, you hardly notice when you have it strapped over your shoulder. It’s that lightweight. We found it is much easier to transport a product like this than to try to pull a canopy tent or a 6 foot-long beach umbrella over your shoulder.</p> <p>Sharing new experiences with your child is one of the great benefits of parenting. Once you get to the beach, your child is going to be excited about the new environment and want to explore with you. You will have to set up your sitting area in the sand while trying to contain your inquisitive child. This isn’t an easy task. The last thing you want to have to worry about is spending any significant time setting up your baby beach tent. Another reason that we like the Pacific Breeze Easy Up baby sun tent so much is because of how easy it is to set up. I’m not exaggerating when I say that it takes less than 30 seconds to set up and tear down. This is a life saver when you have a curious toddler. To set up the beach tent, all you do is remove it from the bag and untie a small cord which allows the legs to naturally fall open. Next you pull a drawstring towards you. The drawstring is attached to the frame in a way that whenever you pull the drawstring, it expands the frame and opens the tent. The process is simple. Teardown is just as easy, which is also important because teardown usually occurs at the end of the day when small children are tired and don’t want to wait while you pack up. There is a central hub in the ceiling of the sun shelter frame. When you detach this hub, the frame loses its rigidity and the tent collapses.</p> <p>The most important reason that you purchase a sun shelter for your baby is so that you can provide him or her protection from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The Pacific Breeze Easy Up canopy has very thin polyester, which is one of the main reasons that the shelter is so lightweight. But, despite the thin nature of the fabric, it is highly resistant to UV Rays. The fabric is rated UPF 50+, which is the highest polyester rating. This rating means that the fabric will repel over 98% of the rays that come into contact with it. This is a great rating and will ensure that your baby will be protected from sunburn. The Pacific Breeze Easy Up beach tent is the lightest UV tent for baby on the market that is able to provide this high level of sun protection.</p> <p>Baby sun tents are essential products for a beach vacation with a young child. They will provide an oasis for the baby to play in, while being protected from the sun. Your baby will be able to sleep peacefully in the shade of a pop up tent, shielded from sun, wind, and debris. The Pacific Breeze Easy Up shelter is one of the most affordable UV tent for babies available. But, it is still built with the quality to last through years of abuse at the beach. It is a wonderful product to have if you want to go to the beach and take a small child with you, but it is also a great product for adults. The Easy Up sun shade is about 4 feet tall, which is plenty of room for kids or an adult to sit under in a beach chair, so even years down the road as your baby grows up, your beach tent will still be valuable to you. It also provides a nice protected and shaded area to place a cooler in as well as your valuables.</p> <p>Overall, we are enthusiastic to vouch for the Pacific Breeze Easy Up baby beach tent and believe that it is one of the best pop up beach tents on the market. It is the perfect option for somebody looking for a lower-end, but well-built beach tent. It is also the best option for anybody who strongly values portability.</p>',NULL,NULL),(16,4,1,'Core','10\'x10\' Instant Shelter Pop Up Gazebo','/img/portable-gazebo.jpg','This gazebo tent is our pick for best overall value because it combinines a sleek modern design with high quality craftmanship while remaining affordable. It is the lightest weight and most visually appealing easy up gazebo on our list.','4.8','https://amzn.to/2vQPErD','<p>Core Equipment is a brand that is more well-known for their high-performance camping equipment than for any portable gazebo. Core specializes in producing lightweight, high quality products for backcountry backpacking and camping. Through years of experience in manufacturing camping tents, Core has learned to develop some of the highest quality and lightest weight waterproof fabrics that we have ever seen. Core uses a state-of-the-art synthetic fabric that is thin and lightweight, but is also durable and waterproof. The canopy fabric is 150D polyester that provides a UPF50+ ultraviolet radiation protection factor. This is the highest rating on the UPF scale and means that the fabric will protect anybody within its shade from sunburn. Core applies a proprietary H20-Block finishing to the polyester to increase its water resistance. From the moment we first saw the product, it was obvious that the brand values quality and aesthetics. The Core 10x10 Instant Shelter combines cutting edge synthetic fabric technology with an appealing design in, what we believe, is the best gazebo tent on the market today in terms of overall value.</p> <p>We found the Core Equipment brand because of input from our readers, actually. A few years ago, we had outdoor enthusiasts from across the country asking us to put the Core 10x10 Instant Shelter to the test. We had heard good things and we’re very intrigued that this company better known for camping tents, had ventured into the portable gazebo market. We’re always excited to hear positive feedback about new gazebos and quickly got our hands on one of our own. When we set the product up for the first time we couldn’t help but notice a general feeling of quality. Seams are double stitched, areas of the gazebo canopy that are subject to additional stress are reinforced, the welding is thick where metal pieces are joined, etc. All of the little characteristics that often go unnoticed, but influences the longevity of a pop up gazebo, were addressed in a way that impressed us. The tent ships with a carrying case that has two web handles and built in roller wheels, making it easy to tote behind you when you walk to the beach, campsite, vendor location, or wherever your journey is taking you.</p> <p>Like most of the products that we recommend, the Core 10x10 Instant Shelter was easy to set up. It took less than two minutes for two members of our team to set up our model, working at an average pace. In order to set up the gazebo tent, two people stood on opposite corners of the frame, each holding onto a leg. They moved backwards which caused the frame to expand naturally. While they were moving backwards they pushed the ceiling sliders upwards which helped the ceiling to take its shape. One of the components that stuck out to us as a valuable feature during the set up process, is the oversized pinch-free hand sliders which allow you to easily move the ceiling joints up the legs. These sliders have a large button that locks and unlocks the joint, which means that you won’t have to worry about pinching your fingers on outdated thumb buttons. The frame is a single piece so there isn’t any risk of losing individual parts.</p> <p>This 10x10 gazebo has straight legs and provides a true 100 square feet of shade, making it a viable option to use in an environment where the product will need to be set up directly next to another structure like at a craft fair or tailgate.  The shelter has three preset height options, giving you the flexibility to adjust height based on your environment. If you need additional headroom, it is easy for one person to increase the height one leg at a time. If you need more cover, is just as easy for one person to lower the canopy. Whenever the Core 10x10 Instant Shelter is set up it looks sleek and modern. The corners of the canopy extend down the legs, adding reinforcement as well as complementing the overall aesthetics of its contemporary design. The canopy has two ceiling vents that allow air to pass through. They look sharp, but also add practical value. Whenever a gust of wind gets trapped under the ceiling, vents allow the pressure to escape reducing the likelihood that your shelter gets carried away by strong wind.</p> <p>When the metal gazebo is set up, it is surprisingly sturdy. This tent uses a pyramid frame design, which is engineered to be as lightweight as possible. Sometimes metal frame gazebo manufacturers try to increase portability by sacrificing durability, but this is not the case with Core Equipment. The gazebo is definitely portable, weighing in at 43 pounds, but its lightweight design does not come at the expense of durability. The metal frame has large steel feet securely welded to the legs that are designed to accommodate stakes through the center of them for additional anchor points. The truss joints and hinges are reinforced with thick plastic and the galvanized aluminum frame is sturdy enough that the pop up gazebo is capable of withstanding prolonged exposure to high impact weather conditions without failure. During our review process we put each product through a set of rigorous physical tests. In one of our tests, we stake down the portable gazebo and leave it set up outside for three weeks to see how it holds up. During the three week period it was exposed to three days of high impact weather, one of which was a thunderstorm. Despite being subjected to high winds and rain, the Core 10x10 Instant Shelter remained standing. The canopy didn’t rip and the joints of the frame are just as sturdy today as they were the day we unboxed it.</p> <p>Our overall assessment of the Core 10x10 Instant Shelter is that is that it is quite possibly the best easy up gazebo available in terms of overall value. It is affordable enough that somebody who only intends to use it for recreational purposes can justify the purchase. Yet, it is durable enough that people who rely on their tent to protect them or their products can feel confident that this metal frame gazebo canopy will provide the shelter they needs in bad weather. It has an appealing modern design that is sleek yet functional. We are big fans of the Core 10x10 Instant Shelter and recommend it to anybody looking for a high quality portable gazebo, at an affordable price.</p>',NULL,NULL),(17,4,2,'ABCCanopy','10\'x10\' Ez Up Gazebo Tent','/img/10x10-gazebo.jpg','This steel gazebo is the strongest product on our list. It features commercial grade durability while not exceeding, what we consider, the recreational price range. It is our unanimous top rated gazebo canopy for use at an outdoor vending event like a craft show.','4.7','https://amzn.to/2DpEVrc','<p>The ABCCanopy Ez Up Instant Gazebo is the strongest pop up gazebo that we have ever seen, and is a favorite amongst our team. It is perfect for somebody who is looking for more strength and durability than a recreational sun shade can provide, but still doesn’t want to break into commercial shelter prices. The ABCCanopy Ez Up Instant Gazebo has all the qualities that you would expect from a commercial-grade pop up shelter such as a steel cross-truss frame, extra thick waterproof canopy, heat-sealed double-stitched seams, reinforced stress points, steel tie down rings, and much more. Despite all of these high quality features, this gazebo tent maintains a price point within, what we would consider, the recreational price range. It dominates commercial-grade competitors because it offers the same features at a lower price. It ultimately affords consumers the ability to obtain a strong and reliable product without the need to justify an expensive purchase.</p>\n<p>The ABCCanopy Ez Up Instant Gazebo is loaded with features, but I am going to start with the one that I think is most important, and that is its frame. Our team stands by a statement that we have made many times in the past. We believe that the single most important investment that you can make to increase the durability and longevity of your portable gazebo is to spend the extra money on a cross-truss frame. Cross-truss frames have additional supporting trusses that extend across the center of the ceiling, preventing joints from being pushed/pulled in directions they aren’t supposed to move. Joints are excellent at absorbing stress along an intended plane plane, but do not hold up well when stress is applied perpendicular to the plane they are operating on. So if you push outwards on the valance of your shelter’s ceiling frame, it is possible to loosen or break the center joint. Cross-truss frames prevent this sheer stress by creating geometric shapes that prevent movement in directions that the joints aren’t supposed to move. The frame is made of black powder-coated rust resistant steel which is a significant upgrade over most frames, which are made of aluminum. ABCCanopy claims that you can stand on the frame without it collapsing. Of course we had to test this. I have to admit that I was too scared to test this out myself, but there are some younger, braver, less intelligent people on the team who eagerly volunteered. As much as I would have enjoyed watching somebody fall from a collapsing metal frame gazebo, it was even more pleasing to see true quality engineering first hand. The steel frame is beyond impressive and easily supported the 170 pound reviewer who climbed on top of it. ABCCanopy has every right to stand by this claim.</p>\n<p>The canopy, itself, is also made with equal emphasis on quality. The fabric is 500D polyester which is by far the thickest out of any on our list and is truly waterproof. It is worth noting that most of the gazebo canopy tents we have reviewed are just water resistant. The seams are double stitched with thick thread, and then heat-sealed to prevent water from permeating through the seams and to prevent the threads from fraying. This is the first time we have seen heat-sealing. We are impressed with the attention to detail and hope other brands adopt this practice in the future. Certain points of any canopy fabric are more susceptible to tearing and leaking because they withstand more stress than other regions. ABCCanopy reinforced all of these stress points with additional fabric. They also added straps along the valance to tie the fabric to the trusses, ensuring that the material remains taught in windy situations. Velco along the interior corner seams of the canopy fabric further prevent movement in wind. The gazebo comes with steel D-rings pre-attached to the corners of the canopy, providing strong anchor points for guy lines. The canopy is built to be able to withstand continuous abuse from high-impact weather, and performed terrifically when we left it set up outside for 3 weeks, which is part of our standard review process. There is unanimous agreement among the Canopy Tent Reviews team that this is the best gazebo tent for wind that money can buy.</p>\n<p>This instant gazebo is heavier than many of the other products that we have reviewed because of its industrial-grade steel frame and upgraded parts. It weighs close to 70 pounds, which is the heaviest product that we recommend, but this is actually a perk if you value stability over portability. It took a little over 4 minutes for two of our team members, working at a leisurely pace, to set up the pop up steel frame tent. The joint slides are made of a strong nylon composite and glide easily along the legs. They have easy-to-use thumb locks so you don’t have to worry about pinching your fingers. Despite the additional weight, the steel gazebo is still easy to set up. The wheeled bag is made out of equally high-quality materials. The wheels are large, strong, and easy to roll, making it possible for the smallest person on our team to effortlessly transport the metal gazebo. The bag has four thick rubber handles for lifting and a fifth rubber handle for rolling. The base plate of the bag is thick and reinforced to prevent ripping.</p>\n<p>In our opinion, the ABCCanopy Ez Up Instant Gazebo is the best 10x10 gazebo on the market today for a craft show or art fair. It has straight 1 1/4 inch steel legs, meaning that the canopy provides a true 100 square feet of shelter, which is important because you want to make sure that all of the products within its footprint have overhead protection. Since the gazebo has straight legs, it can be set up directly next to another structure which is important at a show because sometimes there isn’t space between your area of operation and the next vendor. If you will be conducting business in a professional environment it is important that you are confident in the performance ability of your shelter so you don’t need to worry about it and can remain focused on business. Vendors can rest assured that the ABCCanopy Ez Up Instant Gazebo is strong enough to protect them and their products through severe weather.</p>\n<p>If the weather gets bad or you just want additional protection, the ABCCanopy Ez Up Instant Gazebo comes with four 210D waterproof polyester sidewalls. These sidewalls attach to the ceiling with a heavy-duty zipper and Velcro. Four additional sidewalls will often cost as much as the actual tent, so the fact that they are included makes the price of this product even more unbelievable. Sidewalls can be used individually on whatever side you want to block the wind, or you can use all four of them together, turning the area under your canopy into a private room. When we set this instant shelter up with all four sidewalls attached we noticed that it was significantly warmer inside. So, if you foresee yourself using your easy up gazebo in the fall or winter when temperatures are lower, we think that the sidewalls are valuable accessories.</p>\n<p>Overall the team is blown away by ABCCanopy Ez Up Instant Gazebo and I, personally, think it is the best pop up gazebo on the market. The strength of its frame and the quality of the gazebo’s canopy is unmatched by any other product available today. I highly recommend this product for anybody looking for an industrial-grade portable gazebo with an affordable price tag. It is our unanimous number one gazebo recommendation for anybody who will be using their shelter in an environment where they must have full confidence that it will provide unfailing protection in potential high-impact weather, such as a trade show. We are proud to recommend this gazebo and hope that you have the ability to enjoy it as much as we do.</p>',NULL,NULL),(18,4,3,'Leader Accessories','Instant Pop Up 10x10 Gazebo','/img/gazebo-tent.jpg','This is the most affordable gazebo on our list. We honestly believe that Leader Accessories could double its cost and it would still be farily priced. If you are looking for an inexpensive gazebo for sale, that doesn\'t sacrifice quality, we strongly suggest taking a hard look at this shelter.','4.0','https://amzn.to/2FXMqr8','<p>Every year when we come out with our reviews, we pride ourselves on continually finding the best pop up gazebo available, all while highlighting some of the latest and greatest features we think our readers should pay close attention to before purchasing. We’re big believers in that just because a well-known brand has been a household name for 50 years; doesn’t mean their product is the best. In fact, it is often the smaller or lesser known brands that manufacture some of the best products with the most innovative features because of how specialized they are in this niche. We found this is the case with Leader Accessories. They’re not a new company by any means, and for the past 30 years they’ve been obsessed with protecting our outdoor adventures and pride themselves on a commitment to superior quality and lasting durability. Perhaps better known for their car, boat, or RV covers than they are a portable gazebo canopy, they’ve proven they have what it takes to compete in this space with their 10x10 instant gazebo tent. Our team found it to be the best value buy thanks to quality manufactured components at one of the most competitive price points available today.</p>\n<p>Our initial reaction when this shelter arrived was that Leader Accessories could be charging double for this shelter, and it would still be a good deal. Our team was thoroughly impressed with the quality of materials; from the steel frame, to the reinforced plastic hinges, to the canopy material. After removing the tent from the carrying tote, we quickly attached the 210-denier polyester awning canopy to the metal gazebo top. After inspecting the quality of the polyester, it became apparent Leader Accessories has leveraged their advantage in their knowledge of fabrics. It is a silver back coated UPF 50+ UV protection fabric and is one of best materials we have seen in the use of an awning material, right up there with Core Equipments\' H20-Blocking technology. The silver back helps heat to reflect and radiate off the top of the tent so it does not become trapped underneath. It appears to have excellent seams with attractive stitching and it held up exceptionally well to downpour rain as water beaded right off the material. Another great feature of the canopy top is the vented top for additional circulation. This not only helps to keep those underneath cool, but also allows for air to vent through top on those windy days to prevent the shelter from turning into a sail. We’re highly confident this material will hold up to the elements for many years to come.</p>\n<p>As for the high gauge metal gazebo frame, we found the powder-coated steel is of high quality and the reinforced plastic hinges ensure the joints won’t weaken over time. It comes fully assembled as a one-piece frame so no tools are required with setup, which is common with most shelters today. As always, the straight leg 10x10 design provides a true 100 sq. feet of shade. Research shows pyramid frames, which this shelter is, are typically less sturdy than the typical commercial cross-truss design. But in our testing, we observed the included guy lines with attachments at the top of the corners provided support similar to that of a cross truss design. This is a great feature because pyramid frames are much lighter than cross truss frames. So, the reduction in weight results in a more portable friendly gazebo while still being just as reliable in terms of durability. This shelter tipped our scales at just over 37 lbs., which puts it below the average 10x10 gazebo canopy in terms of weight. Lastly, we found the use of thick plastic sliders with large push buttons in the locking mechanisms to be a great feature to prevent finger pinching when finished using, or when trying to change between one of the leg height adjustments.</p>\n<p>One of the best features of this portable gazebo is that Leader Accessories manufactures side walls in the color option matching your tent. Our team has been hard pressed to find a higher quality material side wall or one that is easier to attach to a gazebo. Using the same 210-denier silver backed polyester as the awning canopy; these sidewalls will block 99% of UV rays and are perfect during windy days, evenings when the sun begins to set, or for added privacy. They each attach with elastic bands consisting of a hook and d-loop. A sidewall comes with 3 bands on each side that attach to the metal legs of the gazebo, and 2 bands on the top that attach to the perimeter truss. Our setup of the side wall was incredibly easy and can be accomplished with just one person. We highly suggest purchasing at least one side wall for your pop up gazebo. In addition to the side wall, the optional weight bags manufactured by Leader Accessories are top notch. Readers often ask us the best way to anchor their gazebo canopy, and before we ever reviewed this 10x10 gazebo we recommended the Leader Accessories weight bags. They are constructed with an outer 600-denier heavy duty material and are 100% waterproof. We found the material, the double stitching on the seams and web handles, and the 4 snap buckles on each bag to be the highest quality available today. Perfect for use on hard surfaces or the beach, they provide the capability for an additional 120 lbs. of anchoring support. Even if you choose to purchase another shelter, purchase these weight bags as we promise you won’t regret it. With these two add-ons, Leader Accessories surely earned the word ‘accessories’ in their name. It\'s worth noting, neither of these accessories are included with purchase on Amazon, and must be added separately.</p>\n<p>Overall, we’re pleased to have found one of the best value recreational gazebo tents on the market today. Seemingly at a price point much less than the competition, our team is delighted to see the attention to detail with the same, if not better, high-quality materials used in tents that are much more expensive. Perfect for picnics, backyard parties, sporting events, fairs, trade shows, festivals, or the beach; this gazebo surely will not disappoint.</p>',NULL,NULL),(19,4,4,'Z-Shade','13\'x13\' Pop Up Patio Gazebo','/img/metal-gazebo.jpg','If you are looking for a decorative patio gazebo, this Z-Shade is a great option. It is designed in a way that the product looks like a permenant fixture and is perfect for use in a backyard, patio, or anywhere that you would perfer a canopy with a more classy appearance.','4.0','https://amzn.to/2DuaYu9','<p>Our commitment to finding the best pop up gazebo on the market today took us beyond the traditional 10x10 recreational shade gazebo. We desired more in terms of aesthetics, but it was difficult to find a metal frame gazebo that met our quality standards and was portable enough to take with us on the go. A gazebo canopy typically falls into one of two categories; a recreational pop up shade tent with telescoping legs that packs nicely into a carrying tote, or a more traditional but less portable patio gazebo with affixed steel legs and a canvas top. We found it very difficult to find a tent that incorporated aspects from both categories; the portability from pop ups and the eye-pleasing features of a garden gazebo, and especially one that we felt comfortable enough recommending to our readers. This was until we reviewed the Z-Shade 13x13 Pop Up Gazebo and put it through testing.</p>\n<p>Z-Shade is a probably a company that not many people have heard of before, but we can bet that you’ve come across a few of their products. For nearly the past 20 years they have been manufacturing instant canopies for customers like EZ-Up, Sam’s Club, BJ’s Wholesale, Cabela’s, K-Mart, and a few other big box retailers. They licensed their technology by proving they had a quality manufacturing process in place, and they’ve built up quite an impressive resume of clients as a result. A few years ago they decided to launch their own private line, leveraging many years of expertise in the field, under the Z-Shade brand. This 13x13 portable gazebo is a staple of their brand outlook in manufacturing convenient yet functional instant shade tents. It a top-notch product made with quality materials and provides an eye-catching aesthetic at a very affordable price, perfect for those looking to give family and friends canopy envy.</p>\n<p>When our tent arrived, the first thing we noticed was that size of the roller bag was larger than a typical gazebo tent tote. This was slightly surprising to us because even though the dimensions of the awning are 13x13, the footprint of the actual metal gazebo is only 10x10. There is an overhang of about 18” on each corner, making up the additional 3’ in length and width on each side. This is a great feature because it provides 170 sq. ft. of shade without the need for additional metal used in the perimeter trusses which we found helps to reduce weight, not to mention adds a cool design factor. Upon removing the tent from the bag, we reviewed the directions but were slightly disappointed in the lack of information and vague diagrams to aid in a quick and hassle-free setup. We found ourselves better off attempting trial and error than we did following the included directions. The roof comes in two separate parts, and as the top peak section will overhang the bottom half of the fabric you will want to set up that up first. We found the two-piece awning gives the gazebo a nice pagoda look that allows rain to runoff and air to circulate through the vents to help keep those underneath cool. Once we attached both awnings to the gazebo canopy, we expanded the frame fully open while making sure the top vent fingers were released over the larger bottom fabric. We weren’t sure how the extended awning would take shape until we attached the extension rods into the top of the legs, which we found to be a much easier installation than we anticipated. Overall, initial setup took us about 20 minutes from start to finish but now takes around 3 minutes with all components attached. We do highly recommend taking down this portable gazebo during storms with prolonged wind and rain to ensure the shelter stays intact. While it might not be necessary to fully pack into the carrying tote, collapsing the awning and telescoping legs will help ensure your gazebo tent lasts many summers. Z-Shade even highlights use on their website that their tents are designed for daily outings or activities, and not extended periods or long term seasonal use.</p>\n<p>The awning material is constructed of high-quality denier polyester with UV coating. After all, protection from the sun is the name of the game during hot days outdoors with prolonged sun exposure. We find it worth mentioning that the polyester is not 100% waterproof and will not provide protection during downpours, but it will aid in keeping those underneath dry during a light rain or drizzle. We found the 3 adjustable leg height options, each about 2 inches apart, to be a great feature for those wishing to raise or lower their shelters. We do want to highlight two downsides that we found to this 13x13 metal gazebo that we hope that Z-Shade will improve in the future. The first of which is the weight of this shelter. At close to 60 lbs., it is one of the heaviest 10x10 footprint recreational tents that we have reviewed in recent years. We would love to see them move to a lightweight aluminum which would not only reduce weight but also improve the strength and structural integrity of the tent. The second shortcoming is that it does not include an insect screen with purchase. The corner skirts provide a great aesthetic to the tent, but we don’t want our readers to misinterpret these for a zipper mesh screen. The Z-Shade website does have 13’ sidewalls available for purchase if you do wish for this option as an add-on.</p>\n<p>Overall, we think this pop up gazebo is one of the best options for those looking for sun protection in their backyard or on their patio. The two-tier awning provides an eye-catching pagoda design that a lot of other metal gazebo tents lack. With easy setup and tear down, it’s as portable as most tents but with much more shade thanks to the 13x13 design. Easily large enough to fit a table and chairs or patio couch underneath, you can quickly turn your backyard or picnic into its own little oasis with this sun shelter.</p>',NULL,NULL),(20,4,5,'E-Z UP','Sierra II 12\'x12\' Shelter','/img/ez-up-sierra-2.jpg','If you find yourself in the situation that you need additional coverage, this is our favorite 12\'x12\' metal frame gazebo. It one of the most affordable oversized gazebos on the market, but still features the durability that you expect from an E-Z UP instant gazebo.','3.9','https://amzn.to/2F3gyjH','<p>The EZ–Up brand is as synonymous to pop up gazebo as Band-Aid is to bandage and Kleenex is to tissue. It’s a company that built its reputation on quality products that are affordable, portable, and most importantly easy to use. We have reviewed tons of EZ-Up products over the years, and we’re continually impressed with every new design the company offers. EZ-Up manufactures metal gazebos for everything including community and sporting events, beach trips, weddings, hospitality, construction sites, to military bases. While they have a gazebo canopy for just about every occasion and have engineered each design to perfectly to fit the intended use, we found that the Sierra II 12x12 Shelter is the most versatile portable gazebo that we have reviewed and can be used on just about any occasion. The 12x12 tapered leg design gives a 144 sq. ft. footprint which leaves ample room for people, tables, chairs, games, and belongings underneath the awning all while maintaining and lightweight frame for easy toting. It is worth noting, however, that the tapered legs result in canopy dimensions of 10x10, which provide only 100 sq. feet of shade underneath the shelter. But, if you are a family of four or more looking to keep everyone safe and shaded while outdoors, look no further than this large gazebo tent.</p> <p>When our shelter arrived, we couldn’t wait to see how big this thing actually was. We were pleasantly surprised that the carrying tote was not much larger than the typical 10x10 gazebo. This is because the additional 2 feet in length and width is collapsed within the folding accordion frame and not in the height of the legs. With a height of about 114”, it is only 6” higher than the average 10x10 gazebo at 108”. This in turn makes the carrying tote about 6” longer, which we found to be a very reasonable tradeoff since we commonly need more space in length and width and not necessarily in height. With the increased dimensions of the powder coated steel frame, we expected the pop up gazebo to weigh more than the advertised weight of 41 lbs. It tipped our scale at just over 42 lbs. which is actually lighter than some of the 10x10 shelters available today. We always preach that a full truss cross frame is the key to a durable gazebo canopy and we typically recommend them over their pyramid frame counterparts. Check out our buying guide for the difference between the two. However, the perimeter truss design does have its unique set of advantages. The perimeter design of the Sierra II provides a clear span cathedral ceiling which increases headroom and clearance as well as gives a more open feel, something that the full truss cross design lacks and our tallest friends appreciate. The perimeter frame also reduces weight as it requires less metal weaving through the top resulting in increased portability, and is ultimately the main reason this shelter weighs less than most full truss 10x10 shelters even given the larger dimensions.</p> <p>So, what are some of features of this portable gazebo tent that make is so reliable and hassle free every time? We found that it starts with the EZ Glide Truss Washers at the joints of the top pyramid frame. Often when we set up a pop up gazebo right out of the bag for the very first time, the top frame is difficult to pull apart because the joints of the perimeter truss are tight and need some massaging until they become worked with repeated use. We observed with the Sierra II that the initial setup was much easier than most and the trusses not only pulled apart with ease, but also felt much sturdier than most other metal gazebos at the cross joints. Once the frame was fully raised, we placed the recreational grade blue fabric top over the cathedral frame and secured with the reinforced Velcro corners. We haven’t had the gazebo canopy for long enough to tell how the polyester material will hold up to the elements, but it seems to be constructed of high quality material with reinforced double stitching at all seems. We’ll put our faith in the EZ-Up reputation for now, and update this review if we find it does not meet our expectations. It is worth noting that while the material might be as highly rated denier polyester as some of the other top shelters, the polyester material is fire resistant and blocks 99% of UV rays, which is something that is critical for hot sunny days outdoors.</p> <p>In our opinion, two of the best innovations EZ-Up has come up with in recent years is the Auto-Slider pull pin and toggle leg adjustments for a quick release of the locks at the top and telescoping legs. We think that both of these are industry leading features that make EZ-Up products the most hassle free and easy to use on the market today. The Auto-Slider pull pin locks into place at the top when the frame is raised into position. Pull these pins when it’s time to tear down, and walk the metal frame gazebo inwards. Similarly, find which of the 2 options for leg height is preferable and the toggle leg adjustments snap into place. With the push of a button located on the toggle adjustment, the telescoping legs release and slide inside of one another. It was hassle free in our testing, and we’re very happy with the design they chose to go with in the Sierra II and we think you will appreciate the pinch free mechanisms just as much as we do.</p> <p>Overall, we think that the value this 12x12 footprint shelter offers in terms of size, portability, affordability, and ease of use is unmatched. We found very little downside in opting for the additional 2 feet in length and width compared to the same tent with a 10x10 footprint. It doesn’t increase weight, compacted dimensions, or portability enough to desire a smaller option. At a very competitive price, the ability to fit all belongings underneath the gazebo tent comfortably while not feeling overcrowded is something we think our readers will greatly appreciate.</p>',NULL,NULL),(21,1,4,'Leader Accessories','Instant Pop Up Straight Leg Canopy','/img/gazebo-tent.jpg','The least expensive shelter on our list, the Leader Accessories is our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best affordable canopy</span>.

True to their name, they have garnered a reputation over the years for leading the way with canopy tent design. While we have tested quite a few Leader Accessories tent, the one which really knocked our socks off is their 10&apos; x 10&apos; Pop Up Canopy Tent. This is a portable canopy which is lightweight and affordable, yet surprisingly durable.</p>\n<p>In its folded-up form, the tent is compact and lightweight. One person can carry it to or from a site with ease. Unfolding the tent, we were struck first by its size, and secondly by how solid it is. Yes, we knew it was a standard 10&rsquo; x 10&rsquo; tent when we ordered it, but somehow it is still surprising to see such a large tent pop up from such a small 49&rsquo; x 9&rsquo; folded profile!</p>\n<p>The frame is solid steel with powder coating and have a heavy duty feel. Both the material and the finish are ideal for resisting corrosion. As for the fabric, that is silver back coated UPF 50+ UV Protection durable 210D Polyester, which is a pretty robust strength for a pop up tent. While the seams are not sealed, they are of high quality, ready to hold up to lots of wear and tear. Very little water gets through them, but you can apply some sealer yourself if you want to waterproof them.</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of setup, one person <em>might </em>be able to get away with setting up this tent, but it is much easier to do it with two people. This is simply due to the spacious size of the shelter. The process itself is ridiculously simple - just unfold the tent, mount the canopy awning to the legs, and extend the straight legs to the desired height. The hardest part was getting the corners at the top locked. But once we did, we were impressed by how secure and sturdy they felt. No flimsy plastic support brackets here, we could really tell Leader Accessories has quality as a top priority. You do not need any tools to get the job done since the frame is in one piece when you get it. If you expect any wind, there are 4 tie-down lines and a set of 8 steel stakes you can use to secure it that come included with purchase.</p>\n<p>Once the tent is set up and ready to go, you&rsquo;ll have at least 100 square feet underneath when the sun is dirctly overhead. Up to 8 people can theoretically sit under this tent, but we felt it was much more comfortable with 6 or fewer. It is ideal for around 4, with lots of luxurious roominess to spread out in, perfect for a day at the beach or some extra shelter at a campsite. You can select any of three height adjustments: 77&rdquo;, 93&rdquo; or 111.&rdquo; You can purchase the tent in a few different colors as well which is something we always enjoy (silver, blue, beige, dark grey and green). We went with the blue, and were pleased with how fresh and vivid the color looked.</p>\n<p>We were determined to see what this canopy tent was capable of, so we tested it out in a couple different conditions. One day was rainy but not too breezy, while the other was a bright, windy day at the beach. The gusts got up to around 20 miles per hour that day. Thanks to the sturdy ropes, the thick polyester, and the two air vents, the tent held up to it all without a single hitch. With the wind shield we bought separately attached, it was very comfortable&mdash;and none of us went home with sunburn. For the other test in the rain, we closed the air vents with the Velcro straps included. We didn&rsquo;t seal the seams, but no more than a few light drops got it from time to time. We&mdash;and the supplies we&rsquo;d brought&mdash;stayed comfy and dry.</p>\n<p>When it comes time to pack up your canopy tent and head home, you&rsquo;ll discover it folds up as easily it pops up. Once again, one person can manage, but two will find it faster and easier. Once it is in the carry bag, you can pull it using the leather handle (no hand fatigue!) and wheels. It should fit inside most vehicle trunks no problem. With the spacious, lightweight and durable Leader Accessories 10&apos; x 10&apos; Pop Up Canopy Tent, in our opinion you can&rsquo;t go wrong and it deserves a spot in our list of best pop up canopy tents.

The Evanston tent is crafted from a 75D polyester fly and a 1000D polyester floor material with inverted seams. This is the first defense against the rain. Also, the patented welded floors make sure that the bottom of the tent does not pool with water. The rainfly window awnings and the zipper cuff provide extra covering from the rain as well. The wind-strong frame makes sure that gusts do not disturb the stability of the tent. To ensure proper ventilation, the Evanston has four large windows. Unlike smaller tents that only have one or two openings, air can properly circulate throughout this tent, which means that condensation is not a problem. This is another way to ensure that everything remains dry. Some people may not appreciate the loss of privacy from opening all of the windows, but they can be closed while a person is changing clothes or sleeping.</p><p>Upon first examination, the Evanston seemed slightly heavier than other tent models.

It measures 16 feet long by 9 feet wide and holds multiple beds. In fact, it feels more like a spacious glamping retreat than a traditional camping tent! The number and length of the poles make it attractive for large groups. They offer enough height for tall campers and extend the space so that no one is crowded. The outside material is quite durable and is crafted from 68D polyester. To ensure that everyone remains dry throughout a trip, this Core tent offers \"H20 Block Technology\". The company uses a fabric that repels water and incorporates \"active bead technology\". This delivers faster runoff so that leaks are never an issue. Also, all of the seams are sealed. The rain-resistant door and window seals keep the weather elements out of the shelter as well. For proper ventilation, there is one opening on the floor that is made of mesh and can be adjusted. On hot days, the cool air can enter the vent and escape through the large mesh ceiling. Want to power your electronics or appliances inside the tent?

We advise staking it down first so that it remains manageable and secure while being pitched. For the large size, the price is quite affordable. At this level, it is rare to find a shelter that fits three large beds and offers similar waterproof features.

It functions like a mini home away from home. The main living space measures 11 feet long by 9 feet wide by over 6 feet high. There is an attached screened room that adds additional space. As this is a flex space, you can use it any way you want, but we recommend it for storing your equipment or just for relaxing. Parents who sleep with their small children will appreciate the space that allows for larger beds. Also, there is plenty of room for toddler gear, including a pack-and-play. The wall that separates the porch from the main tent area has a waterproof 68D polyester fabric layer and a layer of mesh. This keeps the bugs and bad weather conditions outdoors. We were impressed that the panel can be unzipped and rolled to the side walls so that a large open space results. It is evident that six people can easily fit together without feeling cramped or uncomfortable. The fly on the WeatherMaster does not provide full coverage. This is due to the design that is meant to provide unobstructed views from the large windows. Although this fly does not protect the windows completely, there is a waterproof panel that can be closed when rain and wind are issues. Coleman&apos;s patented WeatherTec system works well to keep campers dry as well. The inverted seams and welded corners make sure that no moisture makes its way inside. The style of the floor is modeled after a bathtub. No water will be able to penetrate the 1000D polyethylene material. It is thick and durable, which means that pets will not be able to chew or claw through the fabric. Thanks to its spaciousness as well as its solid waterproofing, this tent makes an ideal choice if you are planning on an extended camping expedition. Even in hot months, ventilation is not a problem. Air can flow easily between the large windows and door.</p> <p>As soon as we went to lift the WeatherMaster, we noticed that it was heavier than most portable tents, weighing in at 32 pounds. That means you probably are not going to want to lug it around while hiking, so it is most suitable if you can transport it in a vehicle. However, it comes with an expandable carry bag with handles. This is a nice feature and makes it easy to pull in and out of a vehicle. Once at a campsite, this tent is relatively easy to assemble. Due to the larger size, it is impossible to properly position without help. However, two of us had the WeatherMaster pitched in approximately 20 minutes. We recommend staking the corners first. This makes it easy to thread the poles and pop them into place. The poles are constructed from fiberglass that is extremely sturdy. Even the strongest wind will not stand a chance against the poles. We advise purchasing better stakes for a camping trip. Although this tent comes with metal stakes for the tent and plastic ones for the rainfly, they appear flimsy and may easily bend or break. Breaking the tent down is just as simple. Even though it may not be easy to pack away without help, two people should have no difficulties rolling it up and storing it in the carry bag. After that, just zip it up to keep everything secure while your tent is in storage.</p> <p>Coleman&apos;s WeatherMaster is not the cheapest tent on the market, but its size and features make it very competitive for the money. More than just keeping you cozy and dry, it gives you a way to feel completely at home and comfortable no matter where you pitch it. It definitely provides quite a value, and it is sure to be heavily used for many camping adventures.</p> <p>Tired of tent flaps that get stuck in the zipper? Rather than making you struggle with another flimsy flap, this product includes an innovative feature: a hinged door. Most tents have simple flaps that get caught up in the zipper and act in a flimsy manner. The hinge on the door makes it extremely simple to walk in and out while holding food or other gear. Families with small children will find that it is convenient when carrying the kids as well.</p> <p>Overall, this Coleman WeatherMaster is the ideal camping option for families or groups that want to remain dry and enjoy spacious accommodations. It has a large living area and a screened porch, which provide a nice place to sleep, eat, and relax in the outdoor environment without being bothered by insects and other exterior pests. The durability of the materials as well as the quality of the waterproofing are hard to rival. In our opinion, it is the best tent for heavy rain and is sure to satisfy all of your camping needs.</p>',NULL,NULL),(26,5,5,'Coleman','Sundome 4-Person Tent','/img/coleman-sundome-waterproof-tent.jpg','Shopping on a budget for a waterproof tent that is ideal for weekend getaways? Its lightweight and compact design also make the Coleman – Sundome 4-Person Tent one of the most portable shelters for hikers. If you\'re on a budget, this unit is the best option there is.','4.0','https://amzn.to/2MURmQJ','<p>Been looking for a budget-friendly tent for the occasional camping trip? The Coleman Sundome 4-Person Tent is worth considering. It is a freestanding tent, which means that it can be pitched on all types of terrain. Coleman is a brand that is known for developing innovative camping gear that allows people to relax with friends at a campsite or to explore the wilderness.</p> <p>The most important part of any piece of camping equipment, especially a tent, is its ability to keep a camper dry in various conditions. Thanks to Coleman&apos;s patented WeatherTec System, the floors have a tub-like design, the corners are welded, and the seams are covered. This means that water will never flood the bottom of the tent. The Sundome has a rain fly design, which keeps rain and wind from becoming problems. For extra protection, it may be wise to seal the seams at a later time. The cover is crafted from a 1000D polyethylene material, which is strong and resists tears. The official waterproof rating on this tent is slightly greater than the average umbrella. That may not sound awesome, but you shouldn’t let it hold you back from considering this tent. We feel that it is a smart idea for a novice camper to consider this tent when he or she will be using it in the summer or mild conditions. Protection from an occasional rain shower or other wet conditions is more than adequate with this piece of equipment.</p> <p>Couples or small families who are looking to enjoy some outdoor fun will find that the size and shape of this tent are desirable. Its height is 59 inches, and it is wide enough for four narrow sleeping pads. If just one or two people will be sleeping in this tent, they will have extra room for their equipment. Pockets are available inside of the tent as well. These are the perfect places to store a wallet and anything else that needs to stay safe. When traveling with a generator or staying at a campground that supplies electricity, the access port will allow a camper to light the tent with an electric lantern or to power personal appliances or electronics.</p> <p>Hate waking up to bright sun, or trying to sleep during the daytime? You will love this tent’s dark room technology which can prevent 90% of sunlight from penetrating to the interior. Also, it lowers the temperature so that the inside stays cooler during the hot summer months. Smaller tents tend to have ventilation issues, but this Coleman has a VariFlo system. There are two windows and a ground vent, which increases air circulation. This eliminates the inconvenience of condensation and other wetness issues.</p> <p>The Coleman Sundome couldn&apos;t be easier to assemble. A single person can pitch this tent in a matter of minutes. When the expedition is at its end, collapsing the tent and putting it away is just as easy. The pole attachments clip automatically, and the fiberglass poles are durable so that minor wind is not an issue. The most obvious advantage of the Coleman Sundome is its lightweight design. It weighs under 11 pounds, which makes it extremely portable. It comes with a convenient storage bag so that it can be neatly tucked away between trips. It holds all of the poles and stakes as well. Most bags have drawstrings, but this one includes a zipper. This makes it simple to keep open when a camper is trying to slide all of the pieces inside. Since it is light and very easy to carry, it is ideal for both campers and hikers. It is a complete holiday package that helps individuals and their families enjoy the mountains, beach, or forest. No matter what a person drives, the compact size easily fits into a car, SUV, or even a motorcycle. But what really impresses us the most about this tent is how budget-friendly it is with such awesome features.</p> <p>With the Coleman Sundance, campers receive a tremendous value for their money. It provides comfort to a camping trip and takes little time to set up. For beginners in particular, the ease-of-use of this tent can make for an easy transition to wilderness camping. It has definitely lived up to all of our expectations. We believe that if your budget is tight, this is the most affordable and best waterproof tent on the market.</p>',NULL,NULL),(27,1,7,'E-Z UP','Sierra II 12\'x12\' Shelter','/img/ez-up-sierra-2.jpg','The gold standard for a 12x12 pop up canopy, this slant leg EZ-Up delivers consistent performance and quality whether it be at the beach, festival, or backyard. It features a large footprint, making it ideal for larger groups or more belongings. It is our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best 12x12 pop up canopy</span>.','4.3','https://amzn.to/2F3gyjH','<p>Easily making it onto our list of top rated canopy tents is the EZ – Up Sierra ll 12 x 12 Shelter. From quality, to design, to portability, to ease-of-use; this tent is constructed with best in class materials and is exceptionally simple to use. We found the option of the extra two feet of the 12 x 12 frame to be something we just couldn&apos;t do without when compared to the same tent with 10 x 10 dimensions. The reason is the tapered leg design. While this design boosts the stability of the tent on windy days, it does reduce the top of the canopy to 10 x 10, so you have 100 square feet of shade underneath.</p>\n\n<p>Since the tapered leg design makes for a wider square footage at the base, you do have more ground for people and belongings. The durability of the frame is remarkably strong and made from powder coated rust resistant steel, painted white. The reinforced plastic hinges are designed with repeated use in mind, while the canopy top is made of a lightweight blue CPAI-84 water and fire resistant material and blocks 99% of UV rays. The open cathedral ceiling provides a peak height of 8 feet 7 inches which we found to be adequate clearance at the valances. There is an underlying theme when it comes to the 12x12 Sierra II, bigger is always better.</p>\n\n<p>Along with the awesome features above, this tent boasts another excellent feature, a recent design change in the top canopy and leg adjustment locks. While this design is catching on with most brands, <a href=\"/brands#EZ-Up\" target=\"_blank\">EZ – Up</a> has pioneered and mastered this technology. With a quick pull of the proprietary Auto Slider Pull Pin, the top lock of the canopy releases and it starts the process of a hassle free tear down. No more fussing with having to push in a metal stopper and pinching your fingers in the process.</p>\n\n<p>A similar design was created for the Toggle Leg Adjustment locking system. With a push of the button, the leg adjusters effortlessly release and there&apos;s no more pinching when adjusting the height of the tent, or during tear down. The ability to choose between one of the two height adjustment options is wonderful as well. We used the lowest height setting to increase shade when the sun was rising or setting in the horizon or on windy days to prevent a gust of wind from catching the underside of the canopy. We would love to see EZ- Up incorporate a vented canopy top to help wind pass through the canopy as well as allow heat to release and not become trapped. Our team found this to be the biggest con of the canopy material. The blue lightweight polyester material with a silver backed lining underneath helps to weigh the tent down. At the same time, it helps protect occupants against sun exposure by successfully blocking UV rays.</p>\n\n<p>It is hard to beat the size and shape of this tent. Most 10x10 slanted leg tents only offer 64 square feet of shade due to the top dimensions being reduced to 8x8. So we&apos;re thrilled to be able to get 56% more shade with a slanted led tent that will be more secure in the wind and give us a larger footprint on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, when a tent is as large as this one, it loses out a bit in the portability department. So, is that the case here? The weight of the this unit comes in at about 41 lbs., which is about average for most 10x10 tents but much less than most 12x12 shelters. This makes it ideal for carrying over a shoulder where you can&apos;t necessarily use the wheels on the carrying bag, such as places like the beach or muddy parks. The bag has two durable web handles that make the tent easily transportable along with two 1 ½ inch diameter wheels for easy pulling. While packed in the bag it has a height of 52&quot; x 9&quot; x 9&quot; so it easily fits in the trunk of just about any car or SUV. So, yes—this is a larger canopy tent. But despite that, there are no worries when it comes to portability.</p>\n\n<p>Setting up a 12x12 tent with just one person tends to be a little trickier than setting up a 10x10 tent. But this may have been the easiest 12x12 setup we have ever done. In just 3 ½ minutes, one member had this entire shelter out of the bag and set up. It&apos;s worth noting that was with the canopy awning already attached. Initial first time set up will take longer as the canopy awning will need to be attached to the frame via the Velcro. However, we&apos;re confident anyone will be able to set this up quickly and easily by themselves after a few trial runs.</p>\n\n<p>Overall we think this shelter can be considered the gold standard for a 12x12 pop up canopy. EZ-Up impressed our team with an impeccable balance of convenience through ease-of-use, affordability, portability, and quality. We see this as being one of the best options for beach goers thanks to the larger footprint and its surprisingly low weight for that size. It will also serve street vendors, fair volunteers, local community barbeques, music festivals, tailgates, or sporting events exceptionally well. For many years, we have given EZ-Up our stamp of approval, and once again, our faith in them has paid off. The Sierra II is just another example of their commitment to excellence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up :</strong> completed in 3:31 minutes with 1 person, and 1:40 minute with 2 people</p>\n<p><strong>Teardown :</strong> completed in 2:46 minutes with 1 person, and 1:21 minute with 2 people</p>',NULL,NULL),(28,6,2,'CORE','10\'x10\' Beach Canopy Tent','/img/pop-up-canopy.jpg','CORE leads the pack in delivering the <span class=\"best-pick\">best traditional-style beach canopy</span> available today. This brand’s 10&apos;x10&apos; Beach Canopy Tent is packed with an array of cool features, including H20 Block technology paired with fully-taped seams to repel rain and water, and 50+ UV protection to repel harmful UVA and UVB rays.','4.6','https://amzn.to/2O5NiwB','<p>When you head to the beach for a long day in the sand, it’s imperative to have a durable sun shelter. The 10&apos;x10&apos; Beach Canopy Tent	is one of the best products you are going to find with respect to rugged, long-lasting design. They’re a company that understands consumer needs and strives to provide the best equipment for camping and other outdoor activities. From the backyard to the mountains or beaches, CORE makes products that enhance a person&apos;s time in the outside world. Their 10x10 Instant Shelter Pop Up Canopy Tent is an item that will be perfect for any beach adventure. Our team believes that it is the best beach canopy tent available on the market today. The silver awning and steel legs provide a great aesthetic but also help to reflect the hot sun. When you fully open the straight-leg design, you will find yourself with 100 square feet of sun protection. That is plenty of space to sit and relax while enjoying the sounds of breaking waves and the company of friends and family.</p>\n<p>Throughout our review, we were continually impressed with the durable construction of this pop up canopy. CORE paid great attention to the details most manufacturers overlook. One of the best examples of this is that the canopy fabric includes taped seams which feature the brand&apos;s unique H2O Block technology. This proprietary technology ensures that hardly any water penetrates the seams. The material is also manufactured with 50+ UV guard that blocks approximately 97 percent of harmful rays. This is a definite asset, and a must have, especially for parents with small babies or a person who wants to protect his or her skin from damage. Thanks to the 10x10 coverage area, it&apos;s possible to set up multiple blankets, chairs, and children&apos;s accessories without feeling cramped underneath. The fabric runs down over the corners of the tent providing good coverage on the eaves, and continues halfway down to conceal the locking mechanisms of the legs. This not only makes the instant sun shelter more visually appealing, it also helps to keep the material taut to prevent water from pooling and stretching the fabric. Lastly, the air circulates nicely on hot days thanks to the roof vents, a feature that we have grown to love on canopy tents and cabanas. Indeed, these vents also help to keep the canopy from billowing when it gets windy.</p>\n<p>No one wants to spend a lot of time setting up a tent at the beach. Most people can&apos;t wait to enjoy the sand and want to jump in the water quickly. We found that with just one or two people working, we were able to get this tent set up and ready to go within just a couple of minutes. After extending the frame, the polyester canopy fabric is easily placed on top and tied with the convenient Velcro tabs. When in position, the leg buttons lock into place. We appreciated the over-sized design of the buttons. They are simple to press, which means that there won&apos;t be any struggles involved with assembly. The included stakes can be used to secure the unit into the sand, and the poles can be guyed out and tied with the sack adjusters. You might want to upgrade to longer stakes or buy some sand bags for additional stability if you expect heavy winds. These will provide better stabilization and peace of mind that your tent is firmly tethered to the ground. As the day progresses it&apos;s possible to change the leg heights, so as the sun moves across the sky, one person can easily adjust the tent height to gain maximum shade coverage.</p>\n<p>Chances are good you are hauling a lot of other supplies with you to the beach, especially if you have kids. Chairs, coolers, and bags that are filled with food and towels are just a few items that are common for a day at the shore. No one wants to have to carry an extremely heavy canopy on top of the rest of the necessities. This CORE Instant Shelter Pop Up appears large, but it folds to a reasonable size. Although it weighs 43 pounds, the included wheeled bag makes it one of the most portable beach canopies around. The last feature that we love for beach use is its flame-resistant construction. It complies with CPAI-84, which means that when evening comes and it’s time for a beach fire in the pit, he or she has peace of mind that this unit will remain safe at all times.</p>\n<p>When it comes time to look for a portable sun shelter for an upcoming vacation, this CORE unit will be the ideal addition to anyone&apos;s arsenal of beach supplies. Thanks to its sun protection, water resistant material, and top-shelf stability and durability, it should offer you long-lasting performance.</p>',NULL,NULL),(29,6,3,'Leader Accessories','10\'x10\' Pop Up Beach Shade','/img/gazebo-tent.jpg','Our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best affordable beach canopy tent</span> is the Leader Accessories shelter. Providing 100 sq. feet of shade, three adjustable height settings, 50+ UV protection, and a solid frame and canopy to guard against harsh weather conditions, it is hard to beat this pop-up beach tent for value. ','4.5','https://amzn.to/2qcriGX','<p>On a visit to the beach, you want to be focusing on having a fun time, not battling with the elements. The Leader Accessories Instant Pop-Up Canopy is a piece of equipment that provides reliable shelter from the sun in a portable package. The brands mission is very simple - to introduce products that heighten the enjoyment and leisure of outdoor enthusiasts. The company has produced quality goods for over 30 years, so customers can trust that they are purchasing functional items with a reputable brand that stands behind them. They come back time and time again and often recommend these quality products to family and friends. With 10’x10’ of coverage, this canopy tent has sufficient space for anywhere from four to six adults to sit comfortably underneath. It is ideal for a trip to the beach, camping, or any other outdoor family activity. This canopy tent for the beach makes it possible to gather family and friends and to enjoy a great day by the ocean without having to worry about harmful UV rays.</p>\n<p>Our team found the straight leg design of this unit simple to assemble. In just a few minutes, two of our team members had this shelter up and ready. When one of us tried to get this canopy up alone, it took a bit longer, but it was still possible to extend the legs and to pop up the top without help or additional tools. The material seemed a bit snug when attaching for the first time, so it is imperative for a person to proceed with caution so that the fabric doesn&apos;t tear. But we think this will be a welcome feature in the long run, as the material will be less likely to puddle and sag during prolonged or intense rain showers. On the legs, there are four buttons that extend the one-piece frame. It was nice that we didn&apos;t have to fumble with our fingers to get the canopy up. The molded locking mechanisms prevented our fingers from being pinched in the process as well, something we always appreciate in the design of these levers. There are three different height settings you can choose from, and making adjustments is fast and easy. That means that this tent can accommodate shorter and taller users. You also can try lowering the height as the sun starts to set to enjoy more shade for longer.</p>\n<p>We were especially impressed with the material of the fabric that was used to construct this portable beach canopy. We have seen countless 10x10 canopies constructed with cheap and low quality fabric, which often do not protect from the rain, wind, or sun. This material is UPF 50+, which provides excellent protection from harmful rays (though it is still important to wear sunscreen). Although this unit is excellent at providing shade, it’s worth mentioning is not waterproof. Since the seams aren&apos;t sealed, water may penetrate the cover during a heavy storm. This is a feature that we would really like to see Leader Accessories incorporate in the future. Double-seamed heat sealed stitching is something we’re seeing more and more of in the top rated tents because of the value it adds in waterproofing the material.</p>\n<p>The steel legs and frame are powder-coated, so they will maintain their appearance without rusting. This coating also helps to boost the longevity of the legs. Thanks to the 4 tie-down guy lines and included 8 steel stakes (4 for legs and 4 to tie down lines) wind will not be a problem. If a person anticipates extreme conditions it may be wise to purchase a set of larger stakes, especially for beach use. We liked the addition of the vents on the top of this unit to assist with proper air circulation, which keeps a person cool in warm conditions and increases stability when wind becomes a factor. If a person is looking to blend the canopy with existing beach chairs or other camping equipment, Leader Accessories makes this unit in a variety of colors.</p>\n<p>This beach pop up canopy weighs approximately 40 pounds. To assist with travel needs, it comes with a convenient carry bag. Even though we felt that it was easy to tote it along without the holder, the leather handle and wheels are a nice touch and definitely make transporting this unit much simpler. Throwing it into the back of your vehicle is easy, and you can keep it in the carry bag for storage when it is not in use.</p>\n<p>Overall, this portable beach tent by Leader Accessories is a smart investment for any summer vacation. It&apos;s built to endure adverse weather conditions, and it provides essential shade on sunny days while at the shore. The fabric safeguards those underneath from harmful UVA and UVB rays. Thanks to the sturdy steel construction and various features that keep it standing firm, we feel that it&apos;s the best canopy for windy conditions while at the beach.</p>',NULL,NULL),(30,6,1,'Neso','Grande 9\'x9\' Portable Beach Sun Canopy','/img/beach-shade-canopy.jpg','At just 6.5 lbs, the Neso is our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best lightweight portable beach canopy</span>. This modern tent provides more shade with its 9x9 canopy than most 10x10 tents thanks to its lower height and angled canopy. Weighing 35 lbs less than the average weight of a typical 10x10, this tent is a lightweight, compact option that provides you with a surprising amount of coverage.','4.8','https://amzn.to/2S3Rykr','<p>The Neso Grande portable sunshade is a great option if you are looking for a canopy tent that offers you the convenience and portability of a beach umbrella. Thanks to its lightweight design, it is easy to move and set up, but it offers more coverage than an umbrella would provide. Neso is a brand with a mission to protect the things that people love. After the company&apos;s founder was diagnosed with skin cancer, he made it his goal to develop products that would positively influence the lives of others. For personal protection or for protection of children and pets, this canopy offers a cover from the hot and damaging rays of the sun. With this Neso tent, it is possible to have a safer time at the beach.</p>\n<p>Setting up this Neso lightweight canopy couldn&apos;t be easier. We simply spread it on the ground and filled the front two anchors with sand. In our opinion, we believe that it is best to keep the front held taut and to leave a little angle by each anchor as this offers the best support. After the front is in place, the back can be assembled in the same manner. When this is accomplished, lock the two poles and place one under each of the front corners, about 1 foot inward toward the center from the corner. In approximately 5 minutes, two of our team members had everything set up and ready to go. Throughout the day on the sand, it may be necessary to shift the pole position as the sun moves. However, we recommend angling the pole against the windy side of the tent at all times. This will prevent the structure from buckling if there are gusts.</p> \n<p>We were very impressed that the quality of this product is as good as it is. The fabric is a Lycra/Nylon blend, which is thick and stretchy. That makes the material durable enough to stand up to high winds and less likely to rip since it is flexible. All corners have a patent pending design with metal grommets in the center that are reinforced with a heavier material which helps keep tears and rips to a minimum. A new stitching technique was used on the corner construction which has greatly improved its durability. The sand bags act like anchors and are also made from the same quality fabric as the canopy. The two included poles are made from rust-proof aluminum, something very important for a product that meant to be near saltwater. Each pole has a soft foam ball on one end that faces the fabric and a square bottom on the other end. Thanks to the sand bags, there is sufficient weight to ensure stability for the canopy, even in the wind. We do recommend that you fill up the sand bags all the way, and then bury them. With its high-quality anchoring system and the design of the canopy, we feel this is one of the best lightweight canopy tents for windy conditions.</p>\n<p>As with any quality sun shade designed for use on the beach, protection against harmful UV rays is a priority with this one. This unit offers UPF 50+ coverage while being water-resistant as well. This means that a passing spot of rain will not ruin the day. The two aluminum poles provide a height of 6&apos; 11&quot; so it certainly provides enough overhead to comfortably accommodate people who are sitting in beach chairs or children who are playing in the sand.</p>\n<p>While the features we have talked about above are awesome, the most outstanding feature of this tent is its lightweight design. When people go to the beach, they often drag tons of other items, including sand toys, coolers, and surf boards. This unit weighs approximately 6.5 pounds, which makes it simple to tote. Even the kids can carry it with ease. Despite the airy appearance, don&apos;t be fooled by the light package being made with cheap materials. This tent is quite durable and will remain steady longer than most beach umbrellas. There is a carrying bag included that has a reinforced cooler pocket on the front, big enough to store drinks, snacks, keys, or a cellphone. When you&apos;re ready to leave, the poles are very easy to remove and the tent is simple to throw into the bag. Everything can be rinsed off at a more convenient time.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, the Neso Grande tent is one of the best choices for anyone who needs shelter from the sun but does not want to lug a heavy item to the shore. This unit offers the same protection as larger pieces of equipment but in an extremely portable and lightweight design. This product also boasts excellent versatility with a range of colors and patterns to suit every taste. There is no better way to experience the shade during a hot, sunny day at the shore or park than with this tent. It is ideal for backyard relaxation as well. It&apos;s worth noting that the footprint of this tent is large due to the sand anchor support lines extending outwards. So if you frequent a beach that is often crowded and tight on personal space, this might not be the best option for you. In this case a typical 10x10 might be best. The brand&apos;s dedication to supplying functional and quality products is what keeps customers returning time and time again. In our opinion, for all the reasons just mentioned the Neso Grande is the best beach canopy on the market.</p>','Best Beach Canopy',2),(31,6,5,'Crown Shades','10\'x10\' Outdoor Pop Up Beach Canopy','/img/best-pop-up-beach-canopy.jpg','With a patented central hub system incorporated into the canopy\'s peak, setup and teardown has never been easier.

Crown Shades is a company that prides itself in both of these criterions with its 10x10 Outdoor Pop-Up Portable Shade Instant Folding Canopy. That&apos;s a mouthful. It has been designed to offer some of the best protection from the sun for any outdoor activity. Thanks to the 10x10 footprint, it can shelter up to six adults without a problem. Crown Shades will make you feel like a king or a queen while enjoying time in the outdoors. In fact, with so many outstanding features, you&apos;ll find yourself looking for any excuse to plan a day out at the beach in total comfort.</p>\n<p>One of your top considerations while shopping for a beach canopy is probably whether you can get the tent setup in a snap. With this product, it will take a minute to pop the top locks into position. Unlike other awning covers that require multiple individuals for setup, this one can be attached with just one person. Anyone who has tried to assemble a sun tent knows that many units have leg pins that are difficult to release. Some corners can be challenging to snap into place as well. With the Crown Shades design, these hassles don&apos;t exist as the legs of the tent contain simple toggle levers. Besides making the assembly stress-free, the design allows the user to extend the legs into different positions. For our team, the most difficult part of setup was taking the tent out of the box. Seriously, we found it to be that simple. Once the frame is spread apart, a person can easily get under the middle of the structure and extend the corners.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most unique thing that makes this one of the best beach canopy tents on the market is the central hub system that Crown Shades has patented. This makes lifting and closing the tent a breeze. The hybrid design combines features of a standard pyramid frame and a full truss cross frame. This unique system provides much-needed support at the top of the cathedral that you just are not going to find in a pyramid frame shelter. The addition of this support noticeably improves the stability of the frame, while adding only a fraction of the weight of a full truss frame. It&apos;s ultimately the best of both worlds. After a long day, you can simply fold up the canopy and be on your way.</p>\n<p>As we put this shade tent to the test, we were impressed by the durable 150D awning and sturdy construction of the steel frame. The awning material repels water and provides UPF 50+ UV protection. So, whether there is rain or shine—or both—during your day at the beach, you will be comfortable under the shelter of your tent. The steel frame will stay in place and will resist rust as a result of the white powder-coated finish, which looks polished and adds aesthetic appeal. Protection from UVA and UVB rays is the name of the game to skin care, and this material is guaranteed to stop these. The top is vented, which means that even the hottest days will not cause a person to roast underneath the shelter. That warm air will be able to rise to the top and escape, keeping it temperate below. The vent on the top increases circulation nicely to keep everyone underneath cool while also reducing toppling during windy conditions. This tent comes with stakes and tether ropes, which our team highly recommends as it will provide extra stability and peace of mind knowing your tent is secure.</p>\n<p>While this tent boasts a lot of great features, it is its overall versatility that really makes it stand out to us as a phenomenal choice. While it&apos;s a top rated canopy for the beach, it can easily be used at home for parties or outdoor celebrations. For large events, you can purchase multiple units and align them next to each other. Since this tent weighs less than 35 pounds it can be toted to the beach, in and out of the car, or around a backyard without a hassle. Another big advantage of this Crown Shades tent is the unique carrying case that comes with the unit. Our team found transporting this canopy was much easier than most of the other tents in the same size and weight class. The case has a reinforced handle and wheels that guide the unit on all types of terrain. We found we were even able to wheel it across sand without trouble. For these reasons, we think it qualifies as one the most portable 10x10 canopy tents available today.</p>\n<p>When a person is on the hunt for a beach canopy, this Crown Shades instant tent is a smart choice. You may not have a ton of money to spend on a canopy tent, but that doesn&apos;t mean you have to sacrifice quality. With this product, you won&apos;t spend a fortune but will receive a functional product that is simple to assemble and easy to use. At its current price, it is the most affordable beach canopy on our list.

At just 9 lbs., it\'s lightweight cabana design and easy to carry bag make it the perfect option for beach goers that don’t want to lug a heavier canopy, but still want to be protected from the sun. We think its the <span class=\"best-pick\">best beach umbrella</span> style canopy you can buy.','4.4','https://amzn.to/2CGbKCW','<p>Nothing complements a day by the ocean like a personal pop up beach cabana. It offers a respite from the sun, and makes you feel as though you are on a private island. To really indulge yourself in a luxurious resort experience anywhere you go, consider the EasyGo Beach & Sports Cabana. It is an inexpensive alternative to a heavier sun shelter and looks classier than a regular beach umbrella. For over 25 years, this brand has provided quality products that keep people comfortable at the beach. All EasyGo products are lightweight, portable, and offer the luxury of conventional cabanas in packages that are simple to assemble and easy to use.</p>\n<p>When you arrive at your spot on the beach, this EasyGo cabana is no more difficult to open than a large umbrella. Two of our team members had it up and ready in less than 5 minutes. When assembled, it is approximately 6&apos;x6&apos; in dimension. The listing says this is sufficient for four adults, but we discovered that it is a bit snug with that many people sitting under the canopy. It is a better fit for two people, or perhaps one person and a pet. Shorter individuals will be able to stand straight without bumping their heads off of the top, but taller individuals might need to crouch while walking underneath. The large support rod that runs down the middle of the structure offers the only support, like a typical beach umbrella, to keep the unit standing upright. It must be twisted into the sand for stability, but a special tool is included so that this task is simple. The supporting rods that run along the top from the center support outwards are crafted from hard plastic that easily snap in and out of the hinges. While the materials seem reasonably robust, we still have some concerns that they could snap under sufficient force. This means that this cabana is probably best used on calm days, similar to most beach umbrellas. Unlike other sun shelters that use stakes to stabilize, the cabanas waterproof fabric runs down on the corners to create supportless legs that give it a traditional canopy shape. Each leg&apos; contains a sand pocket at the bottom, which is a unique way to ensure that the cabana will not move. As an extra measure to make sure that everything remains in place we recommend placing damp, heavier sand in these pockets.</p>\n<p>While a cabana&apos;s primary job is to provide you with shelter when the sun is out, it should also keep you nice and dry if it rains. On this product, EasyGo has used a strong waterproof material that will make easy work of repelling rain showers. Although the sides are open so it might not protect you adequately, this covering will most importantly keep you comfortably out of the hot and damaging sun. Thanks to the vented top, air circulation keeps stuffiness to a minimum. We absolutely love that the fabric is available in various colors and patterns as well. This means that you will be able to choose a cabana that matches your existing beach gear or individual style.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons to select this pop up beach cabana is its portability and lightweight design. In fact, we can go so far as to call it ultralight, since it weighs a mere 10 pounds! Compare this to a typical 40 lbs. canopy tent and you can see why we love it so much. Thanks to the convenient carry bag that comes with this tent, it is simple to transport it to your site. You&apos;ll also find that getting it in and out of the bag is a breeze. A cool feature of the bag part is the outside pocket on the carry bag. It is the ideal spot to store the included stakes and turnkey for the pole. This saves time during the setup process, since you&apos;ll know exactly where these items are, and won&apos;t need to dig for them. The only drawback is the length of the unit. If you own a smaller car, you may need to lay the cabana diagonally so that it fits in the trunk.</p>\n<p>Any day at the beach will be a comfortable and enjoyable one when you set up the EasyGo tent. We appreciated all of the details that went into the design of this unit. The netted compartments at the bottom of the poles are excellent for storing suntan location, a snack, or other tiny items. This keeps things off of the sand so that they are not lost. Don&apos;t expect this cabana to withstand hurricane winds, but an average beach day should be quite enjoyable. It is important to recognize the uniqueness behind the design of this unit. It is a stylish and functional sun tent that will keep the sun from roasting you on bright days. If you want a quality piece of equipment that provides instant shade, this EasyGo Beach & Sports Cabana should be at the top of the list as one of the best lightweight portable canopy tents.</p>',NULL,NULL),(33,6,7,'Eurmax','10\'x10\' Heavy Duty Canopy','/img/eurmax-commercial-canopy.jpg','The <span class=\"best-pick\">best heavy-duty pop up beach canopy</span> available today, this Eurmax provides durability not seen in any other beach canopy. The full truss cross design is much less vulnerable to side and rotational pressure and the reinforced joint struts will decrease stress from windy or rainy conditions. But at 60 lbs, this tent isn\'t for the faint of heart. So, it may be an ideal option if you have a partner to help you carry and set up the tent, or if you do not need to walk far from yo','4.4','https://amzn.to/2Q2A9Gr','<p>In the market for a seriously heavy-duty canopy tent that will hold up to regular wear and tear, providing you with long-lasting, durable performance? The Eurmax brand delivers quality products that have been leading the industry for the development of commercial-grade canopies over the last 20 years. The 10x10 Ez Pop-Up Commercial Instant Shelter is manufactured with high quality materials, and is noticeably stronger than others in the 10x10 class. Its design is pleasing to the eyes and is simple to assemble. With this tent, a person can enjoy a day at the beach where it is essential to be out of the sun and remain covered in style.</p>\n<p>You might think such a hefty tent would require a group for assembly, but just one or two people can handle the job using basic tools and skills. Many times, there are tiny buttons and hinges that catch the fingers and cause minor injuries. This pop up beach canopy has industrial-grade thumb buttons that are used to raise the corners and to adjust the height. You can maximize comfort and protection from the sun at all times with three adjustable heights. Also, people of various heights will be able to enjoy this canopy without problems. It can be frustrating for tall individuals to constantly duck or crouch while walking under the valances, or for smaller individuals to setup and tear down, but we found neither to be an issue during our testing.</p>\n<p>This Eurmax contains a full-truss structure and has square legs with large feet. The reinforced trusses make it sturdier than many other canopies on the market, and we could immediately tell that this shelter was made to withstand a variety of weather conditions including heavy wind and rain. Unlike other covers that are braced at the corners, this unit has crossbars on the sides which help to distribute the stress evenly across the frame, and prevents one particular truss or support from bearing excess weight or wind. From the crossbars, another piece of steel runs toward the apex where there is a strong spring in position which also helps to mitigate the effects of the wind as well. You don’t need to worry about the poles rusting either, thanks to the hammertone powder-coated finish. This is especially important with all of the salt air and water at the beach that can cause corrosion over time.</p>\n<p>While the structure of the frame is very important, the material and design of the canopy is equally so. This shelter uses a dense and premium 500D polyester fabric with seams that are sealed along the entire top, which means that this unit will keep water from penetrating. Also, a must-have feature and perhaps the most important for a beach canopy is its ability to block the harmful rays of the sun. This shelter protects those underneath from 99 percent of UV rays. Also, it is CPAI-84 certified, which means that it&apos;s fire-resistant for those wishing to have a beach campfire nearby. But that doesn’t mean you should ever build a fire underneath it (or any other canopy tent).</p>\n<p>With its robust legs and wide feet, this tent should be pretty stable once you set it up. Almost all tents come with stakes so that the units can be secured to the ground or into the sand. We appreciated the sturdiness of the stakes that are included with this product. Sometimes we find it necessary to purchase stronger stakes as replacements for the original because they’re often too small, but we found that not to be the case with this Eurmax. The included materials work well to hold this heavy duty canopy in place at the beach. We’re very confident that this shelter won&apos;t malfunction or collapse on a windy or rainy day.</p>\n<p>Although this shelter is heavy duty, it can still be easily moved from place to place. This unit weighs approximately 60 pounds, so it&apos;s slightly heavier than other tents in the same class. But thankfully, the carry bag features some great design elements that make transport easy. Due to the slightly heavier design, the carrier contains large wheels that attach to the aluminum base that houses the instant shelter when it is not in use. The carry bag space is very large, which means that the top does not have to be removed from the frame during storage. This saves time when a person is ready to pack up and leave. Within minutes, we had this canopy down and secured away.</p>\n<p>Eurmax manufactures a number of great accessories that you can use to enhance the functionality of this tent. For instance, side walls can be easily purchased and attached to the Velcro valance that is sewn directly onto the perimeter of the unit. This will help increase privacy or keep more of the weather elements from entering the shelter, whether that is sun or rain.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a tent that is durable and affordable, this Eurmax is one of the best beach canopy options out there. It should provide you with years of use over the course of many outings, even if you live in a windier location. We’re confident you will enjoy it for many years in all types of outdoor settings.</p>',NULL,NULL),(34,99,7,'E-Z UP','10\'x10\' Ambassador Instant Shelter Canopy','/img/ez-up-beach-canopy-tent.jpg','This EZ-Up is packed with some of the most user friendly features of any tent that we reviewed.

Impressive attention to detail is what has won this brand so many enthusiasts over the many years they have been manufacturing tents. They continually increase the quality of their products to better meet the needs of the public. This is why it was no surprise to us that the Ambassador Instant Shelter Canopy is one of the best beach canopy tents available today. The design is a straight leg 10x10 footprint providing 100 sq. feet of shade in any exterior setting. With this lightweight sun shelter, you can gather your friends and family for a day at the beach or get ready to tailgate in style.</p>\n<p>Two people can get this lightweight tent set up in a matter of minutes. No tools are required for assembly. Also, you will not have to worry about getting pinched fingers while setting up this tent. Thanks to the toggles on the leg adjustments and the auto-slider pull pins, anyone can have the unit up and secured in minutes. The quick lock release makes storage a breeze as well. At the touch of a button, this canopy will fold down without hassle. We love the ability to adjust the legs to two different heights as well.</p>\n<p>Concerned about passing showers while you are out at the beach? The water resistant fabric will prevent everyone underneath from getting soaked during a passing storm. The advanced technology used on this canopy adds strength and durability as well. For instance, there are heavy-duty end caps and proprietary E-Z glide truss washers. These items keep this tent standing strong and also ensure fast setup. The reinforced fabric is a nice touch that we don&apos;t often see on canopy tent. All of these features should enhance the lifespan of the product, even with regular use. The included spike kit helps to secure this cover into the ground, or sand depending on your location or venue. As always, the most important feature for beach goers is the UV protection that this product offers. With 99% UV protection, this tent shields occupants against UVA and UVB rays. This is why a canopy is absolutely critical for everyone enjoying the sun at the shore.</p>\n<p>This E-Z Up Ambassador Instant Shelter Canopy is quite portable. A customer receives an upgraded roller bag that makes carrying the canopy quite easy. Indeed, at 35 pounds, this tent weighs a little bit less than the average canopy tent. Most adults should have no problem transporting it. The bag itself also includes a lot of great features and benefits. The rubberized sure-grip handles, high-density wheels, and E-Z grab zipper all add to its appeal and function. All of these features increase portability and make transportation hassle-free.</p>\n<p>If you want to add to the functionality of the tent, E-Z Up manufactures a number of add-ons for just about every weather condition. Some of these include weight bags for extra ground security, deluxe stakes, event lighting, sidewalls, and gutters. These upgrades allow anyone to customize their pop up tent and to maximize its usefulness. The valance includes a Velcro strip along the top, which means that the entire shelter may be enclosed by hanging walls as well. This provides added privacy and protection from the wind and rain.</p>\n<p>One feature that our team loved in this tent over others is the headroom that it provides. Do you get tired of having to duck under crossbars in other canopy tents? This tent doesn&apos;t feature any crossbars, instead featuring a unique Clear-Span Center that offers a maximum height of 112 inches. This is quite impressive and is a feature that tall people will appreciate. With this type of design, no one will have to worry about crouching or ducking throughout the canopy.</p>\n<p>When it comes time to research and identify the best beach canopy, the E-Z Up Ambassador is hard to beat. With its robust construction, you can expect this canopy tent to perform great for years to come so long as you are taking care of it and using it in suitable conditions. For a stylish addition to your beach gathering, camping adventure, or outside event, we couldn&apos;t recommend a better lightweight pop up canopy than the E-Z Up Ambassador.</p>',NULL,NULL),(35,99,99,'Caravan Canopy','10\' x 10\' Straight Legged Commercial Canopy','/img/caravan-commercial-canopy.jpg','This is the strongest, most durable canopy tent that we have reviewed. It\'s cross-truss frame provides commercial grade performance, while maintaining a price that is competitive in the recreational market.','4.2','https://amzn.to/2vM1ipy','<p>Caravan Canopy has three core values that they strive to uphold while designing their products. Those values are durability, portability and ease of use. They hit the nail on the head, and stay consistent with all three values with their 10’ x 10’ Commercial Canopy. Caravan Canopy delivers reliability, durability, strength, and overall value with this canopy, while achieving what we believe is engineering excellence. We’re confident this 10’ x 10’ Straight Leg Commercial Canopy will be in our top 5 list for quite a while. Built with a powder coated heavy duty steel frame and hammertone textured finish for extra frame protection, this is one of the most durable and reliable canopy tents on the market. We were impressed with quite a few of its features, but one important one that we want to mention is its patented pull pin technology, which ensures easy set up and tear down. This feature alleviates all risk of getting pinched fingers from traditional thumb-button style telescoping frames. Caravan canopy tents are one of the only canopy tent brands manufactured in the USA.</p><p>The differentiating feature that makes this canopy tent surpass its competitors is its full-truss cross system frame, which provides the strength and stability that you expect from a commercial grade frame. But, Caravan is able to offer this enhanced frame at an affordable price that keeps it within the realistic reach of consumers who intend to use their pop-up canopy primarily for recreational use. We found the heavy-duty steel frame to be of much better quality than the typical aluminum frames of most recreational instant canopies. Weighing in at 48 lbs, it is heavier than average tent of this size because it is built with high-grade steel. Quality and durability are characteristics that we find very valuable, so we believe that the extra weight is well worth the investment. The canopy itself is 500D polyester (most of the canopies we review are 210D) and is both water and fire resistant and provides 99% UV protection. The tent clearance is 11’ and has a max valance clearance of 7’ 2” on all sides, which is higher than the average and provides you with the option to use the canopy in a commercial environment like a craft show. The frame has 5 convenient height options, which gives you the flexibility to set it at the exact height that the situation requires. Most canopies offer 1 or 2 height settings, and we found the 5 height options to be beneficial to maximize shade and reduce sun exposure underneath the canopy. As the sun drops on the horizon, users have the ability to subtly drop one side to maintain shade. This canopy tent is a straight leg design, so the 10’ x 10’ frame is a true coverage canopy providing 100 square feet of shade.</p><p>TThe 600D commercial grade polyester roller bag included with the canopy is the best quality carrying bag we have reviewed. Since this tent is on the heavier side, the industrial-grade roller bag is necessary and makes it convenient and easier to transport to any venue. Attached to the bag are two durable web handles, which makes it easy for two people to carry the tent if needed. As with most commercial canopies we recommend a 2 person setup due to the increased weight, but it could be completed with 1 person if necessary.</p><p>Set up – completed in 4:37 with 1 person, and 2:09 minutes with 2 people</p><p>Teardown –completed in 3:41 minutes with 1 person, and 1:53 minutes with 2 people</p>',NULL,NULL),(36,7,1,'ABCCanopy','10\'x20\' Canopy with Diversification Panels','/img/abccanopy-10x20-pop-up-canopy.jpg','After researching dozens of oversized tents, we decided to choose ABCCanopy as the <span class=\"best-pick\">best overall value</span>.

A brand that is committed to serving the needs of all customers, ABCCANOPY has proven once again why they’re the best in the industry when it comes to manufacturing commercial grade canopies. We have spent years rigorously testing their tents, and with every new innovation, iteration, or improvement they continue to surpass our expectations. In fact, no other brand on the market offers the same great value. And no other brand continually impresses more year in and year out with attention to detail or accurately understands the needs of their customers better than ABCCANOPY. Let us explain why.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a tent with all-inclusive features without a hefty price tag, it is pretty hard to rival the ABCCANOPY 10&apos;x20&apos; Canopy with Diversification Panels. What other tents offer as add-ons for an additional charge, this heavy-duty tent includes in the very reasonable purchase price. Compared to the #2 tent on this list at roughly the same selling price, this tent comes equipped with diversification panels which the Eurmax does not, giving this canopy a massive unique selling position. What exactly are diversification panels?</p>\n<p>Diversification panels are a mixture of sidewalls, door panel sidewalls, half walls, and mesh walls. That’s right, this pop up comes with 4 sidewalls, 2 additional sidewalls equipped with roll up zippered door panels, a mesh wall to protect from those pesky bugs, and two half walls to provide a professional appearance for trade shows professionals and vendors alike. Mix and match these panels to customize your space for your event. The sidewalls are all 210-denier polyester fabric, which is more than adequate to provide water, wind, and sun resistance to those underneath.</p>\n<p>As with all straight leg canopies of this size, 200 square feet of real estate is available underneath the tent. But just what are we talking about in terms of capacity? It turns out that gives you enough space to comfortably seat eight people at two tables. This makes it one of the best wedding tents available to consumers today. Opt to remove all of the sidewalls during a nice sunny event, or mix and match the panels as necessary to quickly provide protection from the elements should the weather change unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>As with all ABCCANOPY tents, the heavy-duty frame is manufactured with powder-coated, rust-resistant steel with nylon plastic connecting hardware on the telescoping legs and corner connections. Most of these materials are industry standard for commercial instant pop up tents with 10x20 dimensions, but we found the square steel legs on this shelter give a higher perceived quality than most other tents thanks for their weight. The frame is of cross-truss design, which we always preach offers much more durability and will surely outlive any pyramid frame canopy. Why is the cross-truss design superior? Because it offers more stability and protection from rotational or sideways breezes. As a result, the frame and canopy are less likely to deform, and hold up better to repeated use.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the telescoping legs to three different heights. Depending on the adjustment you choose, the clearance can be 7.44 ft, 7.8 ft, or 8.1 ft. The thumb lock technology on the legs release the locking mechanisms allowing for pinch-less tear down when it comes time to pack up.</p>\n<p>The material of the top itself is high-strength 500 denier polyester with polyurethane lining, offering 99% protection of harmful UVA and UVB rays. The stitching on the high strength canopy is heat and seam sealed to prevent water penetration. While no tent is 100% waterproof, this one comes pretty close. The included over-sized carry bag is one of the best out there, with highly durable wheels and reinforced handles, which we found are absolutely necessary given the weight of this canopy at 123 pounds.</p>\n<p>Overall, this ABCCANOPY comes in as our top rated 10x20 canopy with sidewalls. This is largely due to the high-quality materials used in the manufacturing process, as well the included diversification panels that no other pop up tent at this price point comes with. The ability to enclose the canopy or leave it open with zippered doors, mesh walls, and half walls provides versatility that few others can match. This pop up met or exceeded nearly every check point on our list.

With their in-house process, they are able to offer superior quality control. This also is what allows them to keep their prices competitive with a well-oiled supply chain.</p>\n<p>If what you are after is commercial-grade quality and heavy-duty construction, this is the tent that will serve you well over years to come. This isn’t your typical lightweight, collapsible, cheap wedding tent that will last one season and go in the trash. Let’s dig into the features and functionality that make this a top rated 10x20 pop up tent.\nThe solid design of this tent starts with the 1.6” hexagon shaped, powder-coated steel legs. A hexagon shape has been proven to be the strongest shape when it comes to supporting and holding structural weight. Hexagon patterns and shapes tessellate, which ensures neither wasted space nor wasted energy. In fact, based on the tests we conducted, these support legs may beat out all others on the market. The hammertone powder-coated finish provides rust resistant properties, an absolute must on a shelter of this size to ensure longevity.</p>\n<p>There are three separate height adjustments on the hexagon legs offering valance clearances of 6.4 ft, 6.7 ft, and 7 ft. That means that this tent can easily accommodate even tall users. A very nice thumb button release levers help to easily unlock the legs and top corner locks when it’s time to pack up the shelter.</p>\n<p>The fabric of the canopy material is the commercial grade standard of 500D polyester with a polyurethane coating, giving it a 50+ UPF grade and blocking 99% of UV rays. The stitching and seams are all sealed to prevent water penetration. While there is no such thing as a canopy tent that can keep out 100% of all water, this one should keep you and your guests dry during light rain.</p>\n<p>Are you shopping for a tent to use at a farmers market or outdoor tradeshow? You are going to love how easy it is to secure your canopy to the ground with ropes or guy lines, thanks to the 4 steel rings at the top corners. Eurmax also has what they call the Truss Muscle on each valance to help the canopy stick on the frame. These Truss Muscles also help to reinforce the joints of the truss system so they don’t buckle or break with rotational pressure, usually a result of windy conditions.</p>\n<p>Eurmax canopy tents include awesome carrying bags, and this pop up is no exception. Made with 1680D polyester, we found it to be the best carrying bag of any 10x20 tent on the market. It has large 4.7” wheels with high-strength corrosion-resistant aluminum, and is big enough to not have to remove the canopy fabric from the frame.</p>\n<p>Overall, this commercial grade instant pop up canopy is a top-rated option for those looking for an oversized tent. We think the best feature is easily the hexagon shaped steel legs. This breakthrough engineering design is probably going to make its way to many competing tents in the coming years. Our team especially loved the fully waterproof canopy fabric, something not seen on many tents.

This coating helps to protect the frame from rust, increasing its longevity. With its sturdy design, it can also take a beating from strong winds without bending or bowing. Whether you use it during a rainy spring day or set it up on the beach where saltwater spray will coat the canopy frame, you can rest assured that you will not see any chips or peeling in the coating for years to come.</p>\n<p>Each circular straight leg measures 1.2 inches in diameter while the truss bars measures 0.5 inches by 1 inch. A durable truss system provides plenty of support and strength when outdoors, and we our testing has revealed that it makes a huge difference in the longevity of a tent.

The sandbag weights are wrapped in black polyester for strength and safety and attach with Velcro loops to the bottom of each leg.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the simple folding truss system and the thumb button levers and corner sliders, set-up for the shelter is a breeze for two people to complete in only a few minutes. Don’t have a second person to help you? No problem. If you are particularly adept at setting up over-sized canopy tents, you may even be able to complete the process on your own.</p>\n<p>To set up the tent, simply pull open the truss system, pulling on the cross bars until they open fully. Secure each bar in place with the thumb button corner sliders in all four corners. Once the top is completely open, you will be able to raise the legs using the thumb button levers to make the tent as tall as you would like. Once the legs are each secured with the included sandbags, all that is left is to place the canopy on the top, securing it easily with the Velcro wind straps.

We are pleased to report that it is just as easy as setting it up.</p>\n<p>This tent is a bit lighter than most others in the same class, coming in at approximately 90 pounds. Please note that weight does not include the sand bags. However, transporting this tent from your home to your vehicle or from your vehicle to the park is simple thanks to the included roller bag. The provided mid-sized wheels are generally easy to roll over flat terrain. Be aware that you will probably need two people to roll it through uneven terrain or over sand.</p>\n<p>Compared to the other tents on this list, we would say that this one can be classified as a mid-price option. It should run you just under $300. While there are some tents of the same size that you can find for less money, most do not offer the all-season strength and durability that this one does.</p>\n<p>This EliteShade may just be the easiest 10 x 20 tent you have ever assembled. Plus, because it can be customized with additional side walls, which are not included, you can use it for just about anything. From a rainy day wedding venue to a beach-side farmer’s market, users love how sturdy and dependable this is in nearly any setting. One thing that sets this apart from other canopy tents is its attention to detail. For example, rather than including short strips of Velcro along the sides, each side of the tent has a full length of Velcro for added strength and compatibility with other canopies. What is more, it is possible to store the canopy while the frame is still attached to it. That can make for even faster and easier setup the next time. Overall, this canopy is the smart choice for discerning users.</p>',NULL,NULL),(39,7,4,'Goutime','10\'x20\' Instant Tent Shelter','/img/goutime-oversized-instant-tent-shelter.jpg','Coming in at nearly 1/3 the price of some of the other canopies on our list, the Vingli is our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best budget 10x20 canopy tent</span>. If aesthetics are important to you for a party or wedding, you might consider this 10x20 shelter. It features cathedral-like valances and window-equipped sidewalls for those looking for a more inviting atmosphere.','4.2','https://amzn.to/3addyAX','<p>If you are in the market for an over-sized tent to use for a party or a wedding, the Goutime 10x20 easy pop up is worth a look. Measuring 10x20 feet, it provides 200 square feet of space in total. We found there is enough room for about 20 guests to sit comfortably underneath. One of our team members had a party planned when we ordered this tent, and that gave us the perfect opportunity for a trial run to review the shelter. Given the relatively low price, we weren&apos;t sure what to expect. But this tent surprised us with its high-quality materials, durability, ease-of-use, and special features, all at a reasonable price point.</p>\n<p>We love that the tent is offered in four colors: white, black, beige, and navy. We picked the navy color because we&apos;re Penn State grads and figured we could use it tailgating if we desired. It features a straight leg design, and includes four sidewalls, two of which have windows. With a lot of competing products, you&apos;d need to order these separately. The canopy tent and the sidewalls all fit inside a compact (4.3&apos; by 1.2&apos; by 0.8&apos;) carrying bag with wheels. Stowing the tent in the trunk of our car was easy, though it did take two of us to carry it to our beach site. The wheels worked great on pavement, but not so well on sand.</p>\n<p>How does setup take on this tent? If there are two people working, they should be able to get it set up in around 15 minutes based on our experiences. It took us slightly longer the first time as we were working our way through the initial set up, but after the first set up it can be put together pretty quickly and easily. With two people on the job, one of them was able to see to the frame while the other managed the canopy, and we were able to get the canopy set up pretty expediently.</p>\n<p>Given the low price for the tent, we figured the materials were going to be cheap and flimsy. In this regard, we were in for a pleasant surprise. The tent is surprisingly lightweight, which is a big plus for a tent of this size, but it definitely isn&apos;t cheap or flimsy. The legs are heavy-gauge steel and are coated to resist rust. The canopy and sidewalls are 210 denier UV-resistant and water-resistant polyester. But you don’t need to worry about this tent blowing away. There are more than sufficient anchor points to keep the lightweight frame in place; six ground stakes and ropes were included in our purchase.</p>\n<p>We were eager to see how many people we could seat simultaneously under the tent with everybody still having plenty of elbow room. We managed to cram 24 people under there, but they didn’t have a lot of room. 20, on the other hand, were able to fit under the tent comfortably. What was also great was that the structure of the frame provided a surprising amount of headroom. Even the taller guests were able to stand upright.</p>\n<p>So, how did the tent hold up to the weather on the day of our test? There were a few strong gusts of wind that day. The sidewalls did a great job keeping them out of the tent, and the canopy didn&apos;t billow too much. But the real test (and the surprise) was when rain showers struck later in the afternoon. We did expect this coming thanks to the forecast, but we left the shelter in place to see how it handled the conditions. It did weather the rain admirably, but the winds weren&apos;t terribly strong. It&apos;s not quite as sturdy as the ABCCANOPY or the Eurmax 10x20, so we wouldn&apos;t suggest leaving this shelter out during sustained winds or downpours. But again, this really is not a surprise given the lightweight materials and design.</p>\n<p>We really like that this shelter is fast and easy to disassemble. But here’s the thing—it is really important to detach the canopy from the frame before you try to store it in the carrying case. If you don’t, you could damage it. So, when you unpack it again later, you need to re-attach the canopy to the frame, adding a step during assembly. This is just a small inconvenience, but still worth mentioning.</p>\n<p>All in all, we were pleased with the Goutime 10x20 easy pop up canopy tent. Even with its relatively low price point, it turned out to be a spacious, sturdy tent made out of high-quality materials with a smart design offering lots of overhead clearance. Setup and disassembly were fast and easy, and the compact carrying case made for easy transportation. Neither small gusts of wind nor rain were an issue; the tent kept both at bay. With side-walls included, it turned out to be an excellent and unexpected bargain given its affordable price point. So, if you are on a budget and are not worried about encountering high winds or rain, think about giving it a try.</p>',NULL,NULL),(40,7,5,'VINGLI','10\'x20\' Oversized Pop Up Canopy','/img/vingli-oversized-canopy-tent.jpg','A great great budget option for any outdoor family event, this large lightweight shelter comes equipped with six sidewalls and is incredibly easy to assemble and disassemble. It is positively loaded with features and is also our pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best easy to use 10x20 canopy tent</span>.','4.1','https://amzn.to/2TaXQ2d','<p>If you are looking for a high-quality pop up canopy that has enough style to make it appropriate even for a wedding or special event, the VINGLI 10x20 is definitely a top option. VINGLI specializes in all sorts of outdoor equipment, including pool supplies, tables and tents. Whether you are hosting a summer pool party or a backyard wedding reception, you’ll love how comfortable and attractive VINGLI tents are. With this sun shelter, you will get instant access to shade, protection from rain and wind and solid construction with customizable options.</p>\n<p>We’ll start our discussion of the VINGLI canopy tent with its sturdy steel frame. The rugged design of this frame holds up great to weather and offers long-lasting durability. In fact, the unique powder-coating on the entire frame stands up to ice, snow, rain and sleet as well as to saltwater. You will not have to worry about the metal framework rusting or peeling. Smooth metal pieces slide over each other well during setup and will not snag or pull on the canopy.</p>\n<p>The strong steel frame connects to six aluminum legs. Aluminum legs help to decrease the overall weight of this canopy tent while also providing flexible strength in strong winds. It is a well-known fact that straight leg designs are far sturdier than their slanted-leg counterparts are. You can adjust the tent to three different heights to suit your needs.</p>\n<p>Planning on putting your canopy tent on a polished floor indoors? This is the perfect product for that purpose, since each leg features a Teflon glide, protecting your floor from scratches. However, if you want to stabilize your canopy with sandbags or other weights, you will need to purchase those separately. The other option is to use the included sewn-on rings for stabilization with stakes or simply to pound steaks through the stabilization bases on each leg.</p>\n<p>The canopy material is another standout feature of this VINGLI tent. Available in white, blue or black, the material is just as strong and durable as the framework is and will be sure to last you for years without any hints of tears, snags or leaking. It&apos;s made from 420 denier waterproof polyester. The slanted shape of the roof sheds rain effectively, and any droplets that remain evaporate fast. Double seam stitching also helps to keep rain out. In addition, the canopy features a special silver coating that resists ultraviolet rays and provides 50+ SPF to those sitting in its shade. Long Velcro straps that wrap around the truss system keep the canopy from blowing away.</p>\n<p>Want to enclose your space for privacy or protection against sideways wind or rain? The VINGLI tent includes sidewalls for these purposes. The sidewalls are also ideal if you want to keep out rain. There are six sidewalls included with this canopy, and each is easily removable from the Velcro attached to the legs and the canopy top. Four of the sidewalls come with vinyl cathedral-style windows while the other two have zip-up doors.</p>\n<p>One of the things we love about VINGLI tents is how fast and easy they tend to be to set up. That is true of this pop-up tent as well. In fact, the manufacturer claims that setting up this tent can easily be a one-person job once you know what to expect. However, you might want to have an extra set of hands nearby during the first time or two that you are setting it up. To set it up on your own, all you have to do is pull the legs apart. Once they are sufficiently spread out, you can step into the middle and press up on the center part of the truss system.</p>\n<p>After you take down the tent, you will find it delightfully easy to transport. The heavy-duty polyester sports-style bag provides great storage for the entire framework and canopy system, and it connects to a roller system so that you do not have to carry it. The rubber handle on the roller bag increases comfort if you have to push your tent down long hallways or sidewalks.</p>\n<p>Because this tent features an aluminum frame, it is pretty lightweight in comparison to some other canopy tents on the market. Weighing in at only 45 pounds, most users will not have a problem carrying this for short distances if they accidentally leave the roller-wheeled bag at home. If you prefer to carry the bag rather than rolling it over rough terrain, two reinforced handles are perfect for team transport.</p>\n<p>As far as affordability goes, this VINGLI is the least expensive tent in our list of top rated 10x20 canopy tents. This shelter will provide you with an affordable solution if you need some shade in your backyard, at your church or your workplace. Plus, the sidewalls are included, which means that is even more economical than it might appear at first glance.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the decorative cathedral windows included on four of the sidewalls, this VINGLI tent is ideal for more luxurious needs, such as weddings. But these sidewalls can be removed if you do not need them, and this tent is ideal for a broad range of applications From vendor shows to family reunions, the uses for this 20-person tent are nearly limitless. If you do have inclement weather, you can shut out the wind and rain with the double-sided zippers on two of the sidewalls. Whether you are inside or outside the tent, the zipper is easily accessible.</p>\n<p>We also love the unique slanted roof of this canopy tent. Not only does it add to the classy look of the overall design, but also it provides some additional headroom for taller guests, especially when the legs are at their highest setting of 6.5 feet.</p>',NULL,NULL),(41,1,5,'E-Z UP','Envoy Instant Shelter Canopy 10 x 10','/img/best-ez-up.jpg','The quickest to set up and also the lightest canopy on our list, the EZ-Up Envoy is our pick for the <span class=\"best-pick\">best easy-to-use canopy</span>. This tent takes the title of &quot;most stereotypical blue canopy tent&quot; to a whole new level. It is a perfect option for your backyard or weekend sporting event.','4.5','https://amzn.to/3Pbi6wL','<p>The <a href=\"/brands#EZ-Up\">EZ-Up brand</a> is to canopy tents what Band-Aid is to bandages and Kleenex is to tissues; trademarks that have become synonymous for the entire product category and set the standard for quality. But that recognition for EZ-Up didn&apos;t happen overnight. For years their product engineers listened to customer feedback and implemented an iterative design process with the ultimate goal to improve user experience and ease of use. One stand-out product in their 10x10 canopy tent line is the Envoy collection.</p>\n<p>The Envoy outdoor shade tent comes with a variety of features that make set up, take down, and transport much easier than previous EZ-Up instant shelters. It all starts with a new and improved frame design that enables the canopy to withstand adverse weather conditions and elements. Weighing only 33 lbs., the Envoy&apos;s frame is 20% lighter than previous models thanks to it lightweight aluminum design, making it much easier to carry from one event to the next.</p>\n<p>The Envoy has a straight leg 10x10 design that leverages its pyramid canopy structure to provide adequate stability and strength across the entire one-piece frame. The unit is equipped with upgraded locking mechanisms that prevent sand and dirt from entering the telescoping legs and that also allow for a simple and easy one-person setup. EZ-Up&apos;s proprietary Auto Slider Pull-Pin technology, located where the legs meet the pyramid frame, provides a quick lock release with an effortless tug of the pin. One of the most popular questions we receive from our readers is, &quot;Which tent is easiest to set up and take down?&quot; It&apos;s not a coincidence EZ-Up built its name and reputation on this process. Their instant shelters are always at the top of our list when we answer this question.</p>\n<p>The locks on the lower legs come with a toggle leg adjustment offering two height settings with valance clearances at 6&apos;6&quot; and 6&apos;2&quot; and a peak height of 9&apos;6&quot; at the center. With the push of a button, the adjusters release allowing for an easy selection of your preferable height option. During our testing, we found it is useful to fully extend two legs up while keeping the other two in their lower position for an angled setup. This height configuration is great for providing shade during a setting sun that&apos;s low on the horizon, or to increase the stability of the pop up shelter on a windy day. We found the hassle-free pinch-less locks to be the best in class compared to EZ-Up competitors. Sore fingers, be gone!</p>\n<p>The frame is assembled upon delivery, the only work needed is to attach the canopy to the frame. Simply open the canopy slightly while in its lowered position, without locking any of the legs or canopy pull-pins, and attach the Velcro to the trusses where the connections are located. The E-Z Glide truss washers reinforce the connection points and provide a nice smooth opening and closing. The Envoy&apos;s canopy is made from a professional-grade, 600 denier polyester fabric that is water-resistant and fire retardant - meeting all CPAI-84 fire resistant requirements. It is worth noting that the blue color can fade if left out in the direct sunlight, so we always advise our readers to put the canopy back in its carrying case when not in use to help prolong the life of the denier polyester.</p>\n<p>One item that we wish EZ Up would incorporate into this tent is a vented canopy. As we all know, warm air rises and can get trapped underneath the canopy with nowhere to go, even on windy days. The vents allow the warm air to escape and the temperature underneath to remain cool. At the same time, these vents provide increased stability during windy conditions by allowing wind to pass through the surface area with less resistance.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Envoy includes a new and improved wheeled bag for easy transport that features high-density two-piece E-Z glide wheels with wide axel support, multi-point handles, and an upgraded zipper. The wheeled bag has been designed specifically for the Envoy frame and can accommodate all of the tent&apos;s components including the four-pack of steel spikes for anchoring the tent. A nylon handle is conveniently located at the top of the bag for easy pulling on hard surfaces, and two nylon handles found on the side of the bag can are designed for carrying the tent over sand or uneven surfaces.</p>\n<p>The Envoy 10x10 instant shelter is one of the best canopy tent options for weekend sports or everyday backyard use. Its heavy-duty construction offers the benefits of a professional-grade canopy at a fraction of the price. It is one of the best value&apos;s on the market today, and we&apos;re confident you&apos;ll appreciate this canopy as much as we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Set up :</strong> completed in 3:38 minutes with 1 person, and 1:39 minute with 2 people</p>\n<p><strong>Teardown :</strong> completed in 2:45 minutes with 1 person, and 1:27 minute with 2 people</p>',NULL,NULL),(42,6,4,'Sun Ninja','Beach Shade','/img/sun-ninja-beach-shade.jpg','The Sun Ninja is a <span class=\"best-pick\">best-selling 10x10 lightweight beach shade</span> that offers exceptional quality in its 50+ UPF four-way stretch spandex canopy with triple overlock stitched seams, 4 aluminum poles, included sand shovel, and more. All of this while weighing a paltry 9 lbs.','4.5','https://amzn.to/3MgQ8Oh','<p>Looking to upgrade your beach gear and find the perfect sun shade canopy for your coastal vacation? While a traditional 10x10 canopy tent is always a great option to stay safe from the sun&apos;s harmful UV rays, more and more vacationers are preferring a modern, lightweight option that leading brand Sun Ninja has made popular in recent years. The metal frame of a traditional pop up tent weighs about 40 lbs., so by replacing the heavy-duty frame in exchange for lightweight freestanding aluminum poles, we&apos;re able to have more portable tents that make carrying over dunes and white sand beaches much, much easier while still providing the same, if not more, shade coverage.</p> <p>Sun Ninja is a well-known, reputable brand on Amazon that has grown quickly in the instant sun shade market thanks to a customer-centric mission that uses high-quality materials and manufacturing processes to produce exceptional tents. They offer two tent sizes; 7&apos;x7&apos; and 10&apos;x10&apos;, and in four vibrant colors; navy, green, royal blue, and turquoise. Our team found the larger of two canopies to be the preferred choice for most customers because the extra square footage of shade makes a huge difference in keeping people, coolers, beach trolleys, and more covered under the shade throughout the day. The extra length on each side might not seem like a lot, but those 3&apos; give 100 sq. ft. of shade compared to the 49 sq. ft. of shade found in the 7&apos;x7&apos; cabana. This doubling of usable square footage under the canopy creates a much more comfortable environment and can accommodate up to 8 people compared to 4 people for the smaller option.</p> <p>The tent fabric is made from durable elastic spandex that has resilient four-way stretch features which will ensure a taut canopy at all times. Its water-resistant properties offer protection from the elements in case any beach sprinkles or light rain showers unexpectedly come your way. We love that Sun Ninja uses triple overlock stitching on all hems of the fabric, whereas most competitors we have reviewed are using a double stitch technique. The triple stitching encloses the seam and prevents the fabric from fraying when under taut stress. Another great feature of the fabric is that it is machine washable, whereas the nylon material on a traditional pop up tent is not. Once summer is over and the tent has inevitably come in contact with saltwater during unexpected waves as the tide comes in, simply wash on a cold, gentle cycle and hang it up outside to air dry. This will keep the tent clean, smelling fresh, and keep from mold and mildew growth while in storage.</p> <p>Perhaps most important on those hot and sunny days is the 50+ UPF the tent fabric provides, so those underneath can feel confident their skin isn&apos;t being exposed to harmful UV rays while reading a book or taking a nap in a beach chair. The fabric is breathable and built to withstand a typical sea breeze and can even tolerate moderately strong wind gusts.</p> <p>The canopy is supported by 4 aluminum poles that are much lighter in weight than their steel counterparts but don&apos;t sacrifice any of the stability thanks to the inverse pressure being applied on the pole from the weight of the sand bags. These anodized aluminum poles are rust-resistant and will hold up to salty beach conditions year after year. An elastic cord tethered inside the poles makes it easy for them to snap together and keeps the pole connected when stored in the carrying bag. The poles measure approximately 6&apos; 6&quot; in height so taller adults can walk underneath with adequate headroom. A circular elastic band comes included to wrap the fabric around the foam ball on the top of the pole for added sturdiness during windy conditions.</p> <p>When it comes to set up, these instant beach tents couldn&apos;t be easier to put together. The entire process from start to finish takes just a few minutes and can be done by one person. Simply pull the canopy fabric out of the carrying bag and extend the anchor bags as far as possible from each other. Use the included sand shovel to begin filling each pocket with as much sand as possible, remembering to be very liberal with the amount of sand used. Once each bag is filled, stretch the fabric as taut as possible. Next, remove the poles from the carrying bag and place each one about 1&apos; from the corner, erecting the tent. Repeat this process for each pole until all 4 are in their correct vertical position. Lastly, bury the sand bags a few inches into the sand to securely anchor them and prevent the tent from collapsing.</p> <p>To summarize why we think this Sun Ninja is one of the best beach canopy tent options on the market today - a large 10x10 design offering 100 sq. ft. shade, portable and lightweight design weighing only 9lbs., strong and durable triple-stitched canopy fabric, 4 poles come included vs. 2 with competitors, quick and easy setup. For all of these reasons, and more, we&apos;re confident you&apos;ll love this tent for many summer vacations to come!</p>',NULL,NULL),(43,7,3,'Master Canopy','10\'x20\' Commercial EZ Pop Up','/img/mastercanopy-10x20-canopy.jpg','If you want an extra-durable oversized tent, it is hard to go wrong with this 10x20 ez-up canopy.

From pop up canopies to more eye-pleasing patio and grill gazebos, this company has a reputation for customer-centric designs and high-quality products. The MasterCanopy Commercial Grade 10x20 Pop Up Canopy is one great example of a durable and easy-to-use shelter that is perfect for everything from backyard gatherings to weddings to soccer tournaments to street vendors.</p>\n<p>The frame for this 10x20 ez up shelter is constructed of high-grade steel with a hammer-tone powder coating. This coating helps to protect the frame from rust, increasing its longevity. Whether you use it during a rainy spring day or set it up on the beach where saltwater spray will coat the canopy frame, you can rest assured that you will not see any chips or peeling in the coating for years to come.</p>\n<p>A frame is built with a full truss structure which we always say is the best design for large commercial canopy tents because it reduces sideways pressure on the frame. With its sturdy design and reinforced truss system it can also take a beating from 50 km/h strong winds without bending or bowing. Of course, you&rsquo;ll need to have the shelter securely anchored with the included sandbags and ropes, but the frame will not bend, break, or collapse under these windy conditions like many competing brands might. Our research has revealed that a durable truss system with strong truss connectors make the biggest difference in the longevity of a heavy duty pop up tent, and this canopy meets those requirements.</p>\n<p>Each square leg of this MasterCanopy measures 1 inch thick while the truss bars measures 0.5 inches by 1 inch, right on par with many of the elite products in this space. The legs have three height options that place the bottom of the canopy valance at 6&rsquo;7&rdquo; up to 7&rsquo;2&rdquo; high depending on the selected height. Included thumb button levers make changing the height of each leg as convenient as pressing a button. Plus, thumb button sliders improve the ease of setting this up as the heavy framework can slide quickly together. You&rsquo;ll find it remarkably easy to attach the canopy to the frame thanks to the strong Velcro on the top valance of each straight leg.</p>\n<p>The 10x20 canopy fabric is manufactured of 200 denier polyester and is water resistant. The doubled stitched heat-sealed seams keep out even the tiniest water droplets. The included wind straps wrap around the truss bars, making this canopy easy to use even on breezy days. The Velcro straps can also be used to attach a side wall to the canopy. However, this must be purchased separately if you wish to include it in your setup. On sunny summery days, you will be glad to know that sitting in the shade of your MasterCanopy will keep 99% of the harmful ultraviolet rays off your skin. In addition, the material has a CPAI-84 rating which makes it flame-resistant for complete peace of mind if used camping.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the simple folding truss system and convenient thumb button levers and corner sliders, set-up for the shelter is a breeze for two people to complete in only a few minutes. If you are particularly adept at setting up over-sized canopy tents, you may even be able to complete the process on your own.</p>\n<p>To set up the tent, slightly pull the frame open to where you can lay the canopy fabric on top and attach at the corners. Secure the material over each corner and then open the frame completely. Secure each truss in place with the thumb button corner sliders in all four corners. Once the top is completely open, you will be able to raise the legs using the thumb button levers to make the tent as tall as you would like. Once the shelter is raised all that is left is to attach the sandbags to each leg to anchor the tent properly and prevent injury. We&rsquo;re happy to report that taking the tent down is just as easy when you are ready to pack up for the day!</p>\n<p>Transporting this tent to your site and back is easy thanks to the large canopy roller bag made of 600 denier polyester fabric. Your purchase includes bonus sandbag weights as well. The roller bag requires a simple bit of assembly when you first receive it to put the included roller wheels on. The sandbag weights are wrapped in black polyester for strength and safety and attach with Velcro loops to the bottom of each leg.</p>\n<p>The weight of this MasterCanopy is comparable to most commercial 10x20 canopies, weighing in at a heavy, but reasonable, 93 lbs. Please note that weight does not include the sandbags. However, transporting this tent from your home to your vehicle or from your vehicle to the park is relatively simple thanks to the included roller bag highlighted above. The provided mid-sized wheels are generally easy to roll over flat terrain. Be aware that you will probably need two people to roll it through uneven terrain or over sand.</p>\n<p>The price is also comparable to other commercial options in its class, currently running around the $400 price point. While there are some tents of the same size that you can find for less money, most do not offer the all-season strength and durability that this one does.</p>\n<p>This MasterCanopy may just be the easiest 10x20 tent you have ever assembled. A shelter like this is an absolute must if you&rsquo;re a street vendor as it&rsquo;s easy to use and will protect you and your patrons from the elements regardless of whether its sunny or raining.

They have perfected the manufacturing of commercial-grade tents, so it should come as no surprise that the most trusted name in the industry is at the top of our 12x12 tent list. But we didn&rsquo;t just give them this title based on our previous experiences, they earned it fair and square. This large canopy was superior to the competition in almost every single category of our review criteria. Let us explain.</p>\n<h4>Frame Construction and Durability</h4>\n<p>As always, we begin with the frame construction and materials, and we can&apos;t overstate how much we love this frame. It is made of high-grade corrosion-resistant steel and finished with a black powder coating that helps add extra protection against rust, peeling, and chipping. The 32mm steel legs have increased thickness over the 30mm legs found on their 10x10 ABCCanopy, which is crucial in supporting the extra weight of the larger frame. The telescoping legs are rugged, and the large, oversized steel footpads marry the pieces together almost like they are one piece. The pads come with small holes for pile-driving ground stakes to help secure the tent when on grass or dirt.</p>\n<p>One of the most unique things about this 12x12 tent is the patent-pending trapezoidal eave system that interconnects the side trusses to strengthen the pyramid frame. No other canopy tent on the market uses this type of design, and it&apos;s a great example of how engineering improvements are being used to increase the durability and longevity of pop up canopies. By adding the additional inner joist within the main support truss, the canopy can withstand significantly more downward and rotational pressure than any of its 12x12 competitors. Great support for windy days!</p>\n<p>Intuitive and easy-to-use cam-lever locking mechanisms are found at the top corner locks and leg locks. Simply press the slider to release the leg locks and choose between three height options. At the highest height setting the valence clearance is approximately 6&apos;2&quot;, which is actually about 3&quot; less than the smaller ABCCanopy 10x10 canopy. We would love to see this increased up to at least 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; in the future.</p>\n<h4>Spacious, Waterproof, and Convenient Shade</h4>\n<p>The straight-leg design provides 144 square feet of shade, which is plenty of space for up to 8 people and chairs. This shelter comes with a heavy-duty 600D polyester canvas top that&apos;s available in 4 different colors; black, white, navy, and royal blue. The canopy is CPAI-84 fire retardant and has been UV treated with a silver coating to provide UPF 50+ sun protection, which blocks 99% of UVA and UVB rays. The material is 100% waterproof and the seams are double-stitched and heat-sealed to prevent droplets from coming through the typically vulnerable seams. Optional 12x12 sidewalls can be attached to provide additional waterproofing as rain will always find its way in from the direction the wind is blowing.</p>\n<p>Anchoring this ABCCanopy tent is simple with the 4 included sandbags, 4 guy lines, and 8 heavy-duty ground stakes. The ropes have hooks on one end that easily attach to the D-ring loops found on all four corners of the canopy legs. The other end of the rope has a toggle that adjusts the tension, which is then looped through one of the 8 steel ground stakes. Alternatively, use the weight bags to anchor the pop up tent at the beach, or fill them with rocks or dirt when on concrete.</p>\n<p>A wheeled roller bag comes included and when packed measures 9&quot; x 9&quot; x 58&quot;, which makes it easy to transport and store when not in use. Given the size and heavy-duty commercial-grade steel construction, it&apos;s hard to believe this unit only weighs 50 lbs. That is lighter than many heavy-duty 10x10 tents and makes it relatively portable given the large dimensions.</p>\n<h4>ABCanopy Recommendation</h4>\n<p>ABCCanopy offers the best 12x12 canopy tent on the market and is perfect for anyone looking for quality materials, durability, and versatility.

Commercial-grade quality without breaking the bank, our easy pick for <span class=\"best-pick\">best 12x12 shade with sidewall</span>.','4.7','https://amzn.to/40pwK9k','<p>MasterCanopy is a company revered in the outdoor categories of canopy tents, gazebos, pergolas, and umbrellas. And their 12x12 instant shelter is a good example of why. It boasts a completely redesigned all-metal heavy-duty steel frame that during our testing proved to be one of the sturdiest of the bunch.</p>\n<h4>Upgraded Design for Reliable Performance</h4>\n<p>The upgraded frame is made of reinforced steel, and the thickness of the legs has been increased from 0.6&quot; in previous models to 1.0&quot;, which is a great improvement. The truss bars have been re-engineered in such a way that helps to distribute weight more evenly to prevent the frame from bowing under heavy winds or downward pressure. The trusses are the most important infrastructure component on any canopy tent, but even more so on 12x12 tents due to the size that is needed to support the roof structure. We love the quality and thoughtful design MasterCanopy has delivered in this product.</p>\n<p>The telescoping legs offer three height settings: 6&apos;1&quot;, 6&apos;6&quot;, and 6&apos;9&quot; which are measured from the ground to the bottom of the valances. The highest setting at 6&apos;9&quot; makes this one of the tallest 12x12 pop up canopies that we reviewed. The more clearance, the better.</p>\n<p>We found the pinch-free adjustment buttons comparable to most competitors, and a much more pleasant experience over the old tents with metal thumb locks.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-align: inherit;\">The straight-leg design provides up to 144 square feet of shade and we comfortably fit an 8&apos; table and chairs underneath, and we had more than enough room to accommodate everyone. Our team even nicknamed this tent &apos;Pinnochio&apos; because each time we set it up, it seemed to only get bigger.</span></p>\n<h4>Improved Canvas and Colors</h4>\n<p>Another feature we love is the canvas material, which has been improved from their previous models. MasterCanopy designed a 3-layer solution complete with waterproof, fade-resistant, and UV-blocking properties. The polyester material is coated with a polyurethane spray to provide 100% waterproofing, and the UV protection provides 50+ UPF to keep anyone underneath protected from sun, wind, and rain. A vented peak canopy gives a modern yet practical design that is different from the plain one-piece top and is also conducive to ventilation and cooling as it allows rising heat to escape.</p>\n<p>While most canopy tent brands offer multiple colors of 10x10 tents, very few support those same color options in 12x12 tents. With options of blue, khaki, white, dark gray, navy blue, red, sky blue, burgundy, and light gray you can find just about any sports team color or match to your existing backyard decor. This is the only tent that includes a matching sidewall with the canopy, adding a great backdrop for vendors or privacy from neighbors.</p>\n<h4>Industry Leading Portability</h4>\n<p>The wheeled carrying case measures 52&quot;x9&quot;x9&quot; which is about 6&quot; smaller than ABCCanopy, giving it an edge in the versatility category. These dimensions are reflective of how portable a tent is, and with a large 12x12 footprint, it&rsquo;s very important to minimize the measurements as trunk space is often limited.</p>\n<p>The wheeled carry bag is made from high-quality 600D coated PVC fabric which is industry standard for top-tier brands. We typically see cases as the first thing to break down as they are usually exposed to the most wear and tear. Having one that is made of durable materials making it less likely to dry rot in storage is critical to the longevity of your tent investment. The roller bag helps to easily transport this unit which weighs about 50 lbs, making it about the same weight as the ABCCanopy.</p>\n<h4>MasterCanopy Recommendation</h4>\n<p>This MasterCanopy is one of our favorite 12x12 canopy tents and is perfect for anyone that needs a large heavy-duty model that can withstand some abuse. We especially love the waterproof canvas and the included sidewall. It is great for those that have smaller vehicles and smaller storage.</p>\n<p><br></p>',NULL,NULL),(46,8,3,'CooShade','Heavy Duty Straight Leg 12x12 Canopy Tent','/img/cooshade-straight-leg-heavy-duty-12x12-canopy.jpg','CooShade takes the category <span class=\"best-pick\">best ease of use 12x12 canopy</span> to another level with its new canopy line. With 99% UV protection and micro-glide PTFE bearings, the setup is almost effortless.','4.4','https://amzn.to/3jBMdT0','<p>Cooshade is a brand you likely will not find in stores as they only sell their products online. They have some of the best-selling canopy tents, umbrellas, instant gazebos, and even grill gazebos on Amazon. They offer shelters in dimensions of 8x8, 10x10, and 12x12 and have up to 10 different colors in stock for each size.</p>\n<h4>Superior Support and Hub Design</h4>\n<p>We particularly love the attention to detail on the high-gauge steel frame. It comes fully assembled and has all the components of a commercial-grade product. This model has been designed with 1&quot; thick telescoping legs and has three adjustable height settings to easily choose the one that best suits your needs.</p>\n<p>Our favorite feature of the Cooshade is found within the top of the tent frame with 8 reinforced cross bars and micro glide polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) bearings. PTFE is a synthetic polymer that is known for its low friction and high heat resistance which provides a smooth and effortless up-and-down movement, making it much easier to set up and take down the canopy. With so many pop up tents on the market, it can often be difficult for brands to differentiate. But Cooshade shows that using advanced materials, even for the smallest of components, can be a big factor in why customers choose one tent over the other if it makes the product easier to use.</p>\n<p>The roof is supported by a hub mechanism made popular by Crown Shades. Resembling a hub and spoke design, the center hub is pushed upwards to lock the center pole into place and support the canvas while the spokes connect to the truss bars to provide stability to the entire tent. This is a hybrid between a full cross-truss and a cathedral frame, offering the stability of a cross-truss design while keeping the materials and weight to a minimum.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The canvas is supported by the center pole and made from a sturdy polyester material reinforced with polyurethane spray which delivers 100% waterproofing and UV protection, ensuring those underneath protection from damaging sun, wind, and rain. Additionally, this model features a vented peak canopy that helps to improve ventilation by allowing heat and humidity to escape while also providing an eye-pleasing two-tier design.</p>\n<h4>Colorful and Compact</h4>\n<p>Aside from the impressive capabilities of the canvas, Cooshade offers tons of color options like blue, khaki, white, dark gray, navy blue, red, sky blue, burgundy, and light gray; so, you&apos;ll be sure to find something you love.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With dimensions measuring 52&rdquo; x 9&rdquo; x 9&rdquo; versatility was not an afterthought. It is significantly smaller than many other available 12x12 pop-up canopies making it an ideal choice for camping trips or festivals. The carrying bag itself is also made from high-quality 600D coated PVC fabric which will ensure it doesn&apos;t break down easily due to wear and tear over time.</p>\n<p>This is one pop up tent that we think you will love.</p>',NULL,NULL),(47,8,4,'E-Z UP','Sprint Series 12x12 Slant Leg Canopy Shelter','/img/ez-up-sprint-series-12x12-slant-leg-pop-up-tent.jpg','This E-Z Up is a great recreational-grade tent that is lightweight and versatile. Weighing just 34 lbs, it is the <span class=\"best-pick\">most portable 12x12 canopy tent</span> of the bunch, features oversized pinch-free buttons, and has an awesome carrying bag.','4.3','https://amzn.to/3Rw7nyA','<p>No &lsquo;best of&rsquo; tent list would be complete without including an E-Z Up instant canopy. They are the OGs, having established themselves as a leader in the industry with over 35 years of experience designing and manufacturing high-quality easy-to-use pop up shelters. Whether you need a tent for a commercial event or just a family gathering, their 12x12 Sprint series is a popular choice because of the great specs and E-Z Up&apos;s consistent quality and customer satisfaction.</p>\n<h4>The Lean and Light Phenomenon</h4>\n<p>The most notable feature is the slanted legs which have a 12x12 footprint but get reduced to an effective 9x9 canopy, offering only 81 square feet of shade. Many recreational grade E-Z Up products&nbsp;have slanted legs because it allows them to be lighter and more portable, making them ideal for outdoor activities that require quick set up and tear down such as a quick soccer game or BBQ. That is the case here weighing only 34 lbs., making the E-Z Up Sprint the lightest 12x12 pop up we reviewed, which adds a great deal of versatility to those who are frequently on the move.</p>\n<p>While the slant leg design does make the tent lighter, it reduces the stability of the structure as the legs do not apply perpendicular pressure to the ground. Compared to straight-leg instant shelters which are more stable because of how they distribute weight more evenly from top to bottom and any external forces such as wind.</p>\n<h4>Elevating Style and Function</h4>\n<p>The red-colored canvas top is made of lightweight polyester, is water-resistant and is 50+ UPF rated. It features reinforced corners with gray fabric to add a signature two-tone E-Z Up aesthetic around the valance. The cathedral ceiling is supported by the pyramid frame which provides a maximum internal height of 8&rsquo;11&rdquo;, which should be plenty of room for an entire basketball team. As always, they use a proprietary auto-slider pull pin and auto-glide truss washers to make it super easy to set up and take down in minutes.</p>\n<p>The Trax roller bag has been upgraded from previous versions, featuring high-density wheels with a wider axle for increased stability on rough terrain like grass. The rubberized handles are a welcome addition over the standard carrying bag with nylon handles, which dig into your palms. And lastly, the traditional zipper was replaced with a heavy-duty zipper because E-Z Up saw this was usually the first point of failure on many bags.</p>\n<h4>E-Z Up Recommendation</h4>\n<p>All of these upgrades make this carrying bag one of the best out there, and as a recreational pop up tent portability is key. Overall we really like this 12x12 E-Z Up Sprint model and would recommend it to anyone looking for an outdoor canopy for an event or backyard party.</p>',NULL,NULL),(48,8,5,'Caravan','M-Series Recreational 12x12 EZ Canopy','/img/caravan-12x12-insant-canopy-shelter.jpg','The Caravan Canopy is the cheapest option on our list and takes the crown for <span class=\"best-pick\">best affordable 12x12 pop up canopy</span>. It features a rising truss system in this M-Series canopy, a hybrid design that offers the support of a cross truss and the headroom of a pyramid-style frame.','4.1','https://amzn.to/3YjHUKW','<p>Caravan Canopy was one of the first brands we reviewed and recommended on CanopyTentReviews over 5 years ago. They were pioneers in commercial-grade tents at a time when everyone else was manufacturing more affordable recreational ones. However, as time passed it seemed that they were not interested in updating their frame structures and ease-of-use features like many competitors were, and they began to get surpassed as a result. That said, their 12x12 straight-leg tent is a great product and one that has been around a long time, but in today&rsquo;s market, it is more comparable to a recreational pop up canopy as opposed to a heavy-duty one.</p>\n<h4>The Rise of the Truss Frame</h4>\n<p>The frame is constructed of lightweight alloy steel, which is more fragile than high-gauge steel used in ABCCanopy, MasterCanopy, and Cooshade products. The legs measure just under 1&rdquo; in thickness which doesn&rsquo;t measure up to the standard of most commercial-grade tents, but since there is less weight to support in the roof structure they don&rsquo;t necessarily need to. Caravan uses its own patented pull-pin technology for the roof locking mechanisms but uses old-school metal push buttons for the leg locks. We would really like to see the same pull-pin design in the telescoping legs, as over time sand and saltwater erode the metal buttons which will cause them to rust, get stuck, and break. Next thing you know you&rsquo;re putting the metal ground stakes in the leg holes just to keep using the tent, we&rsquo;ve been there!</p>\n<p>The most unique part of this 12x12 canopy is the rising truss frame that reinforces the structure and supports the canvas. Caravan only uses this rising truss design in the M-Series Pro 2, so it&rsquo;s worth talking about. This design combines the benefits of a full truss cross system&rsquo;s strengths by using multiple horizontal and vertical crossbars that form a lattice structure, while also offering more headroom clearance found in pyramid-style frames.</p>\n<p>Most 12x12 manufacturers have found creative ways to support the roof structure with some version of a pyramid frame because full cross trusses would add unnecessary weight given the amount of material needed to support their large dimensions. Caravan can get away with it because the lightweight steel alloy materials used throughout the shelter isn&apos;t as heavy as other instant&nbsp;tents.</p>\n<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to compare the canvas to MasterCanopy&rsquo;s material but it is comparable to industry standards, made with 150D polyester, and capable of providing 99% UV protection while also being water-resistant. It connects to the frame via Velcro attachments on each of the four corners, and the valances provide a snug fit over each corner so there is no need to worry about it getting ripped off in windy conditions.</p>\n<p>Room for Improvement</p>\n<p>We think the 420D roller bag could be made with higher-quality material which would make it less prone to damage and wear and tear. It feels cheaply made and has small plastic wheels on a narrow axle built into the bag which makes it difficult to pull on any surface that isn&rsquo;t concrete. Lastly, most pop up canopies come with weight bags included with the purchase, but this Caravan does not so they will have to be purchased separately which we find to be an inconvenience. When factoring in this additional expense, the M Series Pro 2 is actually more expensive than most commercial-grade options and with many inferior attributes.</p>\n<p>As a result, while this is a quality 12x12 recreational tent, it&rsquo;s difficult to justify purchasing it at its current price. When compared to heavy-duty options at similar price points it lacks the quality, durability, and features that extend longevity and make it easier to use.</p>',NULL,NULL),(49,9,1,'Quictent','20x20 White Frame Gazebo Tent','/img/quictent-large-party-tent-20x20-frame.jpg','This Quictent is the only tent with a white powder-coated frame, allowing the steel to blend seamlessly into the canvas. With high-quality hardware coupled with the best customer service in the industry, this is <span class=\"best-pick\">our top pick</span>.','4.7','https://amzn.to/415JylD','<p>The Quictent wedding gazebo is the best 20x20 outdoor event tent due to its unparalleled combination of durability, functionality, style, and exceptional customer service. Quictent (pronounced &ldquo;Quick Tent&rdquo;) has been an industry leader in the instant canopy and gazebo industry for many years, so it should come as no surprise this tent provides reliable protection and a comfortable environment for guests. With 400 square feet of spacious interior and customizable features, such as removable doors and sidewall windows, it&rsquo;s an attractive option for anyone looking to create a memorable event.</p>\n<h4>Structural Design Features</h4>\n<p>The commercial-grade frame boasts 1.5&rdquo; diameter steel poles that have been powder-coated white, differentiating it from most competitors who have raw galvanized steel poles. This is just one of the many unique features of the frame, but one that we love because it allows the support poles to blend seamlessly into the white canvas. The poles have a thickness of 1mm steel walls compared to the popular .5mm used in portable carports and smaller outdoor tents.</p>\n<p>Quictent reinforces its frames with small trusses and joists, providing stability and durability not found in many other tents. The gable roof structure features a small horizontal truss bar that forms a triangle structure at the peak and adds reinforced protection against downward pressure in heavy rains. There are 45-degree trusses where the legs meet the side perimeter poles to reduce rotational pressure in gusty winds. These are just a few of the structural elements that make this a best-in-class frame tent.</p>\n<p>The peak of the roof measures approximately 10ft high, compared to gable roof alternatives like Peaktop Outdoors and American Phoenix which measures a height of 9&rsquo;2&rdquo;. The head clearance of the valance is 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; which is higher than the 6&apos;2&quot; average, so most guests should be able to enter the interior of the tent without needing to duck.</p>\n<h4>Design Elements of the Valance and Canvas</h4>\n<p>The white roof canvas is made of a 180g polyethylene (PE) material which is commonly used in outdoor tents because it has excellent durability, water resistance, and UV resistance, and is lightweight and cost-effective. It doesn&rsquo;t offer the same benefits of PVC vinyl used in many 20x20 industrial canopies, as the PVC vinyl is stronger, more durable, and more resistant to fire and extreme weather conditions. But PE is more practical and often the preferred roof material in many large outdoor tents as it provides all the benefits outlined above at a much more affordable price.</p>\n<p>The doors and cathedral-style sidewalls are both made of lower quality 160g PE, but still offers more than enough protection as they do not need to provide the same waterproofing properties as the roof. The doors measure 7&rsquo;x16&rsquo; on opposite sides of the tent, are solid white like the roof, and can be zippered shut. We really enjoy that the 6 independent windows can be added or removed individually based on preference. Being able to add or remove panels based on outside temperatures, weather conditions, and even party-specific uses is a great benefit many will enjoy.</p>\n<p>The valance extends down over the eaves of the frame and is a straight-edge design as opposed to the scalloped valance found on the Peaktop Outdoors and American Phoenix. We do prefer the scalloped design and think it is classier with a touch of elegance, but the straight edge also offers a nice clean finish that seamlessly blends into the roof and sidewalls.</p>\n<h4>Easy Assembly for Large Gatherings</h4>\n<p>We found the instructions of the Quictent the easiest to follow of any of the 20x20 canopies that we reviewed. It arrived in 3 separate boxes and all boxes were fortified with thin sheets of wood to protect the equipment. We still highly recommend opening the packaging and examining the parts right away to identify any damage and reach out to their customer service, no one wants to find out one of their steel poles is damaged the day of their party. Quictent customer service is also the best that we have experienced. They are happy to answer any questions and will reship damaged items promptly if they are needed.</p>\n<p>No additional tools are required to assemble the tent, everything needed to connect and fasten the hardware is included. The only exception would be a rubber mallet for the stakes, which isn&rsquo;t necessary but will help expedite the setup process. All parts are clearly marked with their respective part number, but we found it helpful to write the part number on the hardware with a Sharpie or color code with tape as it will make the identification process much easier. This will save you time down the road and you will be glad you took this extra step.</p>\n<p>Once the canopy is fully set up, the 400 square feet of shade will comfortably seat a total of 50 people at 8&nbsp;ft round tables. The gable roof design does not require a center pole to support the canvas, so there is ample room underneath to have 5 round tables and plenty of space for guests to walk.</p>\n<p>The 600-denier polyester oxford black carry bags that come with the tent make storage very easy, allowing everything to be neatly packed away when it&rsquo;s time to take it down. To ensure the safety of your belongings in damp or high-humidity conditions, these bags are expertly crafted with a PVC coating that provides 100% waterproofing, giving you peace of mind that your items will remain dry and protected.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>The Quictent Wedding Gazebo is a top choice for anyone needing a large outdoor portable shade tent. With a focus on durability, functionality, style, and affordability, Quictent has created a product that provides reliable protection from the sun and rain and a comfortable environment for guests. If you&apos;re looking to buy a 20x20 tent that has many user-friendly features, this large canopy is a great investment.</p>',NULL,NULL),(50,9,2,'American Pheonix','20x20 Gable Roof Canopy for Weddings','/img/american-pheonix-20x20-wedding-gazebo.jpg','American Pheonix offers the <span class=\"best-pick\">sturdiest frame</span>, constructed of rafters, joists, and trusses that provide superior strength and stability. The heavy-duty galvanized steel ensures that it is built to last and can withstand even the toughest weather conditions.','4.6','https://amzn.to/3YJ5GR7','<p>The American Phoenix tent is another high-quality option, with many similar features to the Quictent. However, there is one standout feature where it outperforms the competition. The similarities start with the gable-style roof and continue to the same roof covering and sidewall materials. The interior is not obstructed by a center pole which allows for a large open tent layout and offers flexibility to maximize seating. Depending on the size and shape of your tables, you can seat anywhere between 40 and 70 people comfortably and still have enough interior space to move around.</p>\n<p>The 180g Polyethylene (PE) roof covering offers the perfect combination of UV protection, waterproofing, lightweight, and affordability. The one difference over the Quictent is that the valances are scalloped as opposed to straight. This is a personal preference, but we think the scalloped curves offer a better aesthetic for weddings and make the structure appear less boxy. The doors and sides are independent of each other and can be removed as needed, and all are made of the same 160g PE. With a height of about 7 feet from the ground to the perimeter pole and a top peak of 10 feet, so if used for a carport the tent can likely accommodate any sedan, SUV, or non-lifted truck.</p>\n<h4>Innovative Design for Ultimate Durability</h4>\n<p>The American Pheonix gazebo has a standout feature that sets it apart from other 20x20 tents on the market. Most tents only support the canopy top with the use of rafters, which connect the eave pole (side pole at the top of the legs) to the ridge pole (highest point of the tent). However, the American Phoenix connects the rafters together with a joist that runs parallel to the eave and ridge pole. The two joists are also connected via a large steel truss bar, and the vertical pole in the middle connects to the ridge pole. All these features work together to create one of the most reliable and durable 20x20 tents available. In fact, this type of design was engineered after the building code of residential roofs.</p>\n<p>The added support helps to distribute weight more evenly across the frame, reducing the risk of damage from heavy snow or wind. Another not-so-obvious benefit is that it gives more flexibility from which to hang interior lighting, compared to others that do not have joists and trusses and need to be hung from the rafters that are further apart.</p>\n<h4>Weight and Portability</h4>\n<p>The tent arrives in 3 separate boxes: one with poles measuring about 8&rsquo; long, another with shorter poles measuring 6&rsquo; long, and the last with the tarp, sides, and hardware measuring about 4&rsquo; long. There are 6 different lengths of poles, compared to the 3 used in the Party Tents Direct Weekender, so it might be more overwhelming at first as you lay out all the parts.</p>\n<p>Having the additional trusses, joists, and connectors adds a bit of time to the assembly process, but it only took 3 of us about 1 hour from start to finish thanks to detailed diagrams and clear and easy-to-follow directions. In our opinion, the included hardware could be improved as the bolt and wing nuts and screw eyes didn&rsquo;t seem to be of the same quality as other shelters. We do like the heavy-duty bungee cords that are used to secure the roof to the poles through metal grommets located around the canopy valence. We found stitching around the metal grommets to be fraying but it didn&rsquo;t impact the ability to tether the canvas to the corner ropes and steel ground pegs.</p>\n<p>The total weight is about 220 lbs. which is comparable to many others of the same style. Being able to disassemble in pieces does make the structure portable, but once assembled it is difficult to reposition. It&rsquo;s worth noting this unit does not come with a carrying bag, so we recommend wrapping the poles in a tarp and getting one plastic bin for the hardware and another for the top and sides to keep everything organized in storage and ready for the next time.</p>\n<h4>Save Money with Replacement Covers</h4>\n<p>Depending on how frequently the tent is used, you might need a replacement canopy if the original is worn out due to wear and tear or from weather damage. You can buy replacement covers and sides from American Pheonix for about $270, so if the frame is still intact it could save you about $400 vs. buying an entirely new tent. Replacement covers can also be a cost-effective way to change the color or style of the tent for different events that you might host. Just be sure to confirm the dimensions and style of your roof covering&nbsp;before purchasing.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>In summary, with nearly all specifications and materials on par with the best 20x20 canopies and the major standout feature in the design of the roof rafters, trusses, and joists it is a tough decision between the American Pheonix and the Quictent. Ultimately, you can&apos;t go wrong with either one of these options if you&apos;re looking to buy a large 400-square-foot outdoor tent.</p>',NULL,NULL),(51,9,3,'Party Tents Direct','West Coast Style 20x20 Pyramid Tent','/img/20x20-tent-party-tents-direct-pyramid-canopy.jpg','The Weekender 20x20 pyramid tent comes with a PVC vinyl roof covering, the <span class=\"best-pick\">best there is in roof material</span>. The canvas is more resistant to fire, UV radiation, and extreme weather conditions.','4.4','https://amzn.to/3XI3TdT','<p>The Weekender West Coast Series by Party Tents Direct is the perfect solution for those looking for a sturdy and spacious outdoor shelter and willing to sacrifice a bit on visual appeal. The 400-square-foot tent is a heavy-duty, robust pyramid-shaped structure designed with poles that connect each leg to the center peak hub, eliminating the need for a center pole to support the canvas. Made of high gauge steel, the frame is built to withstand harsh weather conditions but the exposed steel legs do not make it the most visually aesthetic party tent. While it might not be the best buy for a wedding tent, we think this is the ideal option for corporate events, festivals, fairs, or community gatherings.</p>\n<h4>Frame and Fittings</h4>\n<p>The frame is made of the popular 1.5&rdquo; diameter galvanized steel and the fittings from 1.25&rdquo; schedule 40 steel are finished with zinc plating. Zinc plating is an electroplating technique that helps to protect the steel from rust and other forms of corrosion, extending its lifespan and improving the durability of the fittings. An advantage of this frame is the uniform pipe length, facilitating easy assembly. The legs and perimeter are built with two poles, while the corner and hip rafters have three interconnected pipes each, all connected with bolts and wingnuts.</p>\n<p>This tent features three types of fittings: corner, side tees, and an 8-way crown. Unlike a tent that uses a center pole for support and has corner and side fittings with three openings, the fittings on this shelter have four openings since the canvas is not supported by a center pole. The additional opening accommodates the corner and hip rafters that attach to the 8-way crown at the peak of the tent. All of this additional steel results in the tent weighing about 250 lbs., which is about twice the weight of a 20x20 center pole canopy tent. Although the heavy weight makes transportation more difficult, it adds stability to the structure and is a tradeoff we believe is worthwhile for those who prioritize safety.</p>\n<p>The 8 rafter poles extending to the peak provide good connection points for string lighting compared to the center pole which would only accommodate lighting around the perimeter. If your party is at night, you&rsquo;ll surely want some way to attach LED lights to keep the party going.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a tent with a more refined and sophisticated look, this may not be the best choice for you. The legs are uncovered and the visible steel may not be aesthetically pleasing for events like weddings. In this case, a gable roof tent like the 20x20 Quictent may be a better option as it provides a more elegant design with the canvas extending down from the roof to cover the poles.</p>\n<h4>Roof Materials, Sidewalls, and Replacements</h4>\n<p>The roof material is made from PVC vinyl, our preferred material for large industrial tents. Compared to polyethylene material which is commonly used in large recreational-grade tent roofs, PVC is stronger and heavier and a better choice when greater protection is required. The scalloped valance extends over the eaves and has attachments underneath for optional sidewalls. The sidewalls come in a variety of styles and all are made with the same PVC vinyl. While it would be great to have them included with the purchase, we understand why they are sold separately in order to maintain an affordable price point, especially since not everyone may need them. It&apos;s worth noting that many other tents offer this feature.</p>\n<p>While the open sides provide consistent airflow on hot days, the ventilation under the tent is comparable to similar options. To improve ventilation, we think it would be beneficial for companies to utilize vented roof slots that are commonly found on smaller 10x10 canopy tents. These vents allow rising warm air to escape through the peak of the canopy, which can be particularly useful in reducing heat and humidity&nbsp;buildup.</p>\n<p>In the event your canopy gets damaged, Party Tents Direct offers 20x20 replacement canopies so you can avoid the cost of buying a brand-new one. They offer materials in PE and PVC vinyl, as well as a number of different colors and styles, and range anywhere from $200-$300.</p>\n<p>This 20x20 Weekender is versatile in terms of its anchoring system, making it suitable for a wide range of surfaces. The frame can be anchored on concrete surfaces and grass, providing a more stable and secure structure that can withstand harsh weather conditions. This feature is not available on the center pole Weekender, which is designed to be anchored only on grass surfaces. The added versatility makes it a great option for driveways and parking lots, providing greater flexibility for different events and occasions.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>The Weekender West Coast Series canopy pole tent by Party Tents Direct is an excellent choice for anyone seeking an industrial-grade outdoor event shelter. Built with a high gauge steel frame and a tarp roof made from thick PVC vinyl, it is some of the best quality components we have found in our testing. Assembly was a breeze with uniform pipe lengths, sturdy fittings, and quality hardware. While it may not have a refined and sophisticated look, we think this is the best 20x20 option for backyard birthday parties, festivals, and fairs.</p>',NULL,NULL),(52,9,4,'Peaktop Outdoors','20x20 Tent for Carport or Outdoor Event','/img/peaktop-outdoors-20x20-frame-tent.jpg','An industrial-grade event tent that is constructed of 28 easy-to-assemble steel poles and features 20&apos; ground poles that reinforce the legs. The removable cathedral sidewalls create an open-air pavilion, making this a the <span class=\"best-pick\">best tent for wedding receptions</span>.','4.3','https://amzn.to/3xutRa9','<p>Peaktop Outdoors might be a company best known for portable carports, but their large 20x20 canopy is the talk of event planners everywhere. Offering 400 square feet of shade, it is commonly used for events like weddings, birthday parties, farmer&apos;s markets, backyard BBQs, or family reunions, this canopy shelter keeps everything under it protected from UV rays and passing showers.</p>\n<h4>Interconnected Pole System for Added Stability</h4>\n<p>Constructed with industrial-grade 1.5&rdquo; diameter rust-resistant galvanized steel poles, this party tent is built to handle anything thrown its way. We especially love that the poles are made with 1mm steel sidewalls, compared to the .5mm thickness on many similar products. Having used both pole thicknesses we must say the difference in quality between the two is noticeable. The frame is relying on all 28 poles to interconnect and support the roof structure and canvas, so the quality of these poles is paramount to ensuring a safe outdoor space.</p>\n<p>The shape of the roof is a standard gable design with two sloping sides that meet at the peak, providing a classic look that can be ideal for weddings and upscale events. The valance extends 12&quot; over the eaves and features scalloped edges that serve to hide the metal poles and hardware and conceal the attachment points of the sidewalls and windows. In our opinion, the scalloped edges add a decorative touch and a more attractive aesthetic to an otherwise boxy shelter.</p>\n<p>The 20&apos; ground bars that connect the 4 vertical side poles and add stability to the walls are one of our favorite features of the Peaktop Outdoors tent. While other tents only rely on vertical poles with steel foot pads that can be staked into the ground, this design doesn&apos;t reinforce the bottom of the frame, making them more susceptible to toppling in windy conditions.</p>\n<h4>Extended Walls for Water Runoff</h4>\n<p>The roof covering is made from the same 180g PE found commonly found on similar tents, providing durable and cost-effective shade that will keep all guests protected. The removable cathedral windows and doors feature the same 160g PE as well, which are well-built and double-stitched to prevent leakage. The walls and doors are extended which allows for water to run off away from the tent, a very cool feature that will help to keep the interior ground dry.</p>\n<h4>Challenges and Tips for Assembly</h4>\n<p>The tent arrives in 3 boxes and assembly should take about 2 hours with 2 people. It took 3 of us about 1:20 minutes to get it fully assembled once we had all the pieces removed from the carrying bags. Ensuring a level ground where the tent will be set up is a critical yet commonly overlooked step, as attaching the roof canopy properly can prove challenging if the 20x20 frame is uneven.</p>\n<p>We did find the instructions difficult to follow at times, it had plenty of diagrams but there were many poorly worded steps. Even after setting up a number of these large tents, we had to repeat a few steps due to missing information in a prior step. One issue we came across was the small truss bars that connect the roof supports have pre-drilled holes that will not line up properly if the ground is uneven, or if the previous connections have been fully torqued. We ended up drilling new holes to get the proper alignment, but for this reason, we recommend only hand-tightening all the nuts and bolts until the very end to save time and complications.</p>\n<p>The metal grommets on the canopy are well made, and although a few of them were fraying they didn&rsquo;t impact anchoring the roof material to the ground. If the wind gusts are strong enough, the large surface area of a 20x20 tarp can turn your structure into a sail, so we always recommend using steel anchors and nylon rope to give increased wind resistance and durability. It only takes a few minutes but is well worth the damage prevention and safety risks.</p>\n<p>We left the tent set up over a 3-day weekend and had no problem with wind or structural damage during that time. It briefly rained during one of the days and all equipment underneath stayed dry, the waterproof test passed! During the birthday party, we chose to remove all the sides and doors to keep the ventilation airflow circulating and a slight breeze helped to keep those underneath cool throughout the afternoon.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>Overall the Peaktop Outdoors is a versatile shelter that we can confidently say is suitable for hosting a variety of outdoor events or parties. The durable industrial-grade frame is constructed with 28 rust-resistant galvanized steel poles and the roof is made of a sturdy and lightweight polyethylene material that provides excellent protection against the elements. The doors and sidewall windows can each be removed to increase airflow and customize your tent&rsquo;s functionality!</p>',NULL,NULL),(53,9,5,'Party Tents Direct','Lightweight 20x20 Center Pole Tent','/img/party-tents-direct-portable-20x20-center-pole-tent.jpg','Weighing just 120lbs, this Weekender is the only center pole canopy in our lineup, making it the <span class=\"best-pick\">most portable event tent on the market</span>. A great option if you are frequently setting up events at different locations.</p>','4.1','https://amzn.to/3XJjt8S','<p>For us, products must always come from trusted brands. For the past 25 years, Party Tents Direct has been one of the biggest retailers of industrial tents for weddings, festivals, and corporate events. They are a top-rated company that carries an excellent assortment of premium party tents in ubiquitous styles to suit various customer specifications. All frame tents from Party Tents Direct are made using high-quality, commercial-grade materials with excellent durability and brilliant canopy shelter designs.</p>\n<p>The Weekender is named as such because of its perfect blend of commercial and recreational features, making it an ideal choice for everyday consumers looking to buy an affordable 20x20 tent.</p>\n<p>It is easy to assemble and is lightweight relative to other options. It creates the ideal atmosphere for an array of outdoor events including weddings, parties, graduation celebrations, and more. Offering up to 400 square feet of shade and engineered specifically for at-home, backyard, or light-duty commercial use, it&rsquo;s a great choice for a myriad of weekend occasions!</p>\n<h4>Type of Materials Used in This Tent</h4>\n<p>Material type and construction are important factors to consider for large pop up tents. The tent frame consists of eight separate side poles with a 1.25&quot; diameter, which are made up of two pieces, as well as a thick 1.5&quot; diameter center pole that is made up of four pieces. It&apos;s worth mentioning that in comparison to many 20x20 frames that are made entirely of 1.5&quot; diameter poles, the use of 1.25&quot; poles puts this frame at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>The poles are all made of galvanized steel that is resistant to rust and corrosion, and the fittings are manufactured with schedule 40 steel and finished with zinc plating. Each of the eight side poles is supported by an anchored guy line and ground stake, and the weight of the canvas adds additional reinforcement once the tent is fully assembled. The center pole supports the peak of the canopy, keeping the canvas taut and stabilizing the entire structure.</p>\n<p>It is important to mention that while the center pole dramatically improves the stability of the overall canopy, it has some negative side effects. The most efficient table layout to maximize seating under a 20x20 tent is to have four 8&rsquo; diameter tables in each corner and one 8&rsquo; diameter directly in the middle. This center pole does not allow for the middle table, resulting in up to 10 lost seats. For that reason, center pole pop up tents might be best used with standing cocktail tables as opposed to large seating tables.</p>\n<p>The Weekender uses a robust, translucent 14oz PVC vinyl material for the roof that is 100% waterproof and resistant to UV light, mold, mildew, and flames. The 14oz refers to the weight per square yard, which effectively means this is one heavy-duty tarp. PVC vinyl is a synthetic polymer well-known for its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions like rain, wind, and sunlight. We love that each of the four panels is double-stitched and bonded with 1&rdquo; heat-sealed overlapped seams, ensuring that not even the smallest drop of water penetrates the stitching.</p>\n<h4>Roof Shape and Design</h4>\n<p>The 20x20 structure features a center peak roof design, creating a pyramid shape that peaks in the center at 12&rsquo; 9&rdquo; and 7&rsquo; on the sides. The scalloped valances add an elegant factor and overhang the eaves by 10&rdquo;, which makes head clearance approximately 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;. Aside from the more visually appealing design of a pyramid roof over a gable roof, there are also a few advantages to this style. The higher peak at the center provides more vertical space in the middle of the tent, creating a more spacious feeling for guests. Additionally, because the pyramid roof does not have a flat side it is more resistant to windy conditions than roofs with two&nbsp;flat sides. Lastly, because the gable shape is often associated with carports, the pyramid shape is preferred for formal outdoor events like weddings as it gives a more elegant aesthetic.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the design of the center pole frame makes it more difficult to hang string lights across the interior of the tent. We love the warm and gentle atmosphere lights provide for evening weddings, but you might be limited to hanging the lights around the perimeter due to the lack of connection points needed to anchor the lights under the canopy.</p>\n<h4>Assembly Tips</h4>\n<p>We were incredibly pleased to discover that erecting this 20x20 tent is a manageable and straightforward process with just two people. First, we completely rolled out the canopy by pulling the material taut and laid each of the side poles next to the grommet openings of the canopy. Next, we hammered the anchoring stakes vertically into the ground approximately 3.5 feet from the canopy&apos;s edge, leaving 6&rdquo; showing above the ground. It is important to note each corner will have two guy line anchors while the four middle poles will have just one.</p>\n<p>Starting with the corner poles on the same side, we located the metal grommet holes and inserted the pole pin through both the grommet and double D-ring. While one person held the pole vertically, the other person tightened the guy ropes using the included plastic tension block. We repeated the steps when it was time for the side poles.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we connected the center pole and placed the pole pin through the center grommet hole. It is important to not fully erect the center pole at this stage, rather keep it at an angle while you go back and secure the 8 side poles to ensure they are perpendicular to the ground. We raised the center pole vertically and hammered the last 6&rdquo; of the stakes into the ground.</p>\n<p>When the event is over and it is time to take the tent down, simply go through the same steps in reverse and you&rsquo;ll be on your way.</p>\n<h4>Unique Features We Love</h4>\n<p>While this party tent does not come with sidewalls, they can be purchased separately on the Party Tents Direct website. They offer three different types of 20x7 sidewalls: solid white, two cathedral windows, or clear. Ropes are permanently installed on the inside of the valances to connect sides, and the walls easily clip onto the rope with plastic connectors. We love all three sidewall options and think the cathedral windows are a must-have on at least one side if you&apos;re buying for an outdoor wedding.</p>\n<p>The feature that makes this 20x20 different from all others is that it only weighs 120 lbs, half the weight of alternative products that weigh 250 lbs. on average. Whereas those structures have interconnecting steel frames and support trusses contributing to their weight, the central pole design removes the need for an interconnected frame, leaving just the weight of the side poles and roof tarp.</p>\n<h4>Our Verdict</h4>\n<p>This weekend-ready pole tent is great for shading and sheltering your friends and family. The sidewall-free design allows for airflow on hot days and offers plenty of shelter for large groups of people on rainy afternoons. If you&rsquo;re hosting a large event and need to seat 50 people the center pole might reduce your table space so this might not be the best option for you. But if you&rsquo;re looking for a lightweight, compact, and versatile pyramid-shaped tent for a backyard birthday party or community event at a local park, this tent is worth your consideration.</p>',NULL,NULL);

An infants skin is particularly vulnerable during the first 6 months of life because they haven’t yet developed all of the melanin, the skin pigment that provides sun protection, that they will have when they get older. In addition to this, due to how delicate the skin is early in life pediatricians only recommend introducing sunscreen around 6 months of age. This ultimately leaves parents with one option during the first few months, to shield them from the sun. It’s our responsibility to do whatever is necessary to protect our children in these vulnerable stages of life. Fortunately, the best baby beach tents are able to protect our baby or toddler from harmful ultraviolet radiation and also provide a comfortable shaded area to play.</p> <p>The top baby tents are becoming increasingly popular because of their convenience, affordability, and portability. For parents who already have arms full of baby products, it is much easier to carry a lightweight 7-pound pop up tent over a shoulder than to drag a 45-pound canopy tent behind you. Baby sun tents are the perfect size for beach use because they are small enough to easily fit on a crowded beach in tight spaces, but also large enough to play or park a stroller underneath them.</p> <p>We prefer sun shelters that remain usable as your baby grows. We found the best tent is a one that is large enough to fit the entire family, not just a baby or toddler. There are many sun shelters that are built and marketed specifically for small children. These are effective when your child is small, but they’re not practical for a growing family This is why we recommend purchasing a traditional beach tent instead of a smaller UV tent for a baby. Beach shades designed for adults have all of the features that make baby pop up tents appealing; like UV protection, instant setup, portability, etc. But they are large enough that they can continue to be used as the baby grows. Parents will get value from a <strong>beach sun tent</strong>, regardless of whether or not they are vacationing with their baby. Most are large enough that two adults can comfortably sit in a beach chair within their shade. They are also great places to station a cooler and beach gear.</p> <p>We’d much rather see our readers get long term use out of their sun shade, rather than have them sit in storage once their baby or toddler outgrows it. When your child is small, the beach tents that we recommend will keep them safe and cool while you relax and enjoy the sunshine. But, when that time eventually comes when your child won’t need constant sun protection anymore, you will still be able to use your shelter as your own beach oasis. We have made it our mission to not only find a great tent, but specifically identified ones that will serve as the best beach tent for any family with a baby.</p>','/img/best-baby-beach-tent.jpg'),(4,'best-pop-up-gazebo','Pop Up Gazebos','Portable Gazebos','https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hersh09-20&keywords=pop%20up%20canopy%20tent&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=xm2&linkId=cf40ee07aec9157f9bf33c91aeb396a1','Best Pop Up Gazebo Canopy 2023 - Portable Gazebo Tent Reviews','Best Portable Gazebo 2022 - Portable Gazebo Tent Reviews','Discover the top pop up gazebo.

Check out our reviews of the top rated water resistent tents so you stay dry on your next camping trip!','<p>How can you make the most of the great outdoors this year? To enjoy nature to its fullest, you’re going to need a quality waterproof tent. Nothing can put more of a damper on a camping trip than to have ourselves or our gear get wet. From clothes to food to electronics, it’s critical to keep all of our belongings dry. Fortunately, there are things we can do to mitigate the risk of an unknown forecast, and it all starts with finding the best waterproof tent. The tent is the command center, hub, or focal point of any camping trip; so, its absolutely necessary we get this piece of equipment right.</p> <p>To come up with our list, we started out by identifying the most important features in a waterproof tent. It all starts with the capability of the fabric to resist water. There are shelters made from synthetic fabrics like nylon, polyester, polyurethane or laminate hybrids all with different types of weaves, coatings and weights. But how can we determine the best kind to keep us dry? And which of these of materials are more breathable and allow better ventilation? And along with rain typically comes strong winds. The engineering and sturdiness of the fiberglass poles can not be overlooked as its one of the most important measures to identify a shelter capable of withstanding the sustained winds of a rainstorm.</p> <p>Next, we look at the size and interior space of each shelter. While a small 2-person tent will serve most hikers perfectly, families will want a larger 4 or 6-person tent to sufficiently fit everyone inside. No one wants to be cramped and uncomfortable for long periods of time inside a tent that is too small for everyone. For this reason, we still favour oversized tents. Doing so ensures enough space for all campers as well as plenty of gear.</p> <p>And lastly, we take a look at ease of use, portability, and affordability. It’s true—tents used to be a challenge to set up, but that has changed. Now, matching tent loops and color-coded fiberglass rods make setup fast and easy. With two people they can be pitched in less than 10 minutes, something most of us would have dreamed of 20 years ago. When it comes portability, keep in mind your intended use of the product. Will it be for hiking or car camping? While a 5 lbs. tent will be perfect for hiking, a larger 20 lbs. shelter might be the better option for car camping and camp sites without a long hike. We’re also firm believers that you don’t have to break the bank to purchase a quality product. Our recommendations are solely based on the value we believe these products will provide, and most of the shelters we identified are more affordable than competing products with similar specs.</p> <p>To compile this list of the <strong>top waterproof tents</strong>, we researched pretty much every option currently available. We’ve answered all of the questions you might have in depth through our detailed reviews. But, if you have any questions that we haven’t addressed please don’t hesitate to ask us.

This is largely because of how convenient and user friendly they have become, with one piece frames, telescoping legs, high quality folding roofs, and carrying bags with wheels for easy transport. In fact, they are just as convenient as umbrellas nowadays, but offer far more in the way of functionality! We&apos;re firm believers that pop up canopies serve beach goers more effectively than any other type of instant shade. Before we dive into the reviews, we want to quickly highlight some of the most important features so you know what to look for before purchasing.</p>\n\n<p>In our beach canopy reviews, the first thing we look at is the UPF rating of the shelter. Similar to SPF in sunscreen, UPF is the Ultraviolet Protection Factor of any material or fabric. 50+ UPF is considered the gold standard for blocking UV rays, so always make sure your tents fabric has this rating. The next major factor we consider is how portable the tent is, and what features make it easy to transport to and from your site. Most vacationers travel to their spot in the sand with trolleys filled with towels, chairs, coolers, food, toys, and shovels. Having a lightweight tent will ultimately make travel more leisurely and save your back. Manufacturers today are looking for creative ways to save on weight to increase their products&apos; portability, and we&apos;ve highlighted a few of these unique products in our reviews below. Next, we look at the stability and durability of the tent, as high gusts of wind and adverse weather are common on the shore. Durability features not only include the materials used in manufacturing of the frame, but also stakes or tie-down capabilities to ensure the canopy doesn&apos;t topple in rainy or windy conditions.</p>\n	\n<p>Lastly, we look at the affordably of the tent. We&apos;re big believers that you don&apos;t need to spend a fortune to get a high quality product. Our aim in these reviews is to determine which products return the most value to our readers. Why would anyone want to over spend on a product where they could get the same, or even better, value and protection from a more affordable beach canopy? So, with all of the above criteria in mind, we have put together a list of beach canopy tents that will give you a great bang for your buck.
