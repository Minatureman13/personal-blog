Manufacturers of commercial-grade canopies rarely make slant leg tents for this reason. Straight leg tents resist rotational pressure better, especially ones with cross truss frames which is something you won't find on angled leg canopies. Cheap recreational tents under $100 often have slanted legs because they require less material to make and as a result can be marketed at a lower price."

Sandbags are typically the most effective way to secure a pop up tent while at the beach so you won't have to transport the weight.

Weighted plates that slide onto the tent's steel feet are recommended for hard surfaces like decks, patios, or parking lots."

So in 10 mph winds, 40 lbs of weight or 10 lbs on each leg should be sufficient to safely keep your canopy tent anchored. For anchor bags that can be filled with sand or rocks, we recommend filling the bag to the top as they are designed to contain the exact amount of weight needed to keep your tent safely grounded. We always recommend anchoring your canopy with one of these methods regardless of wind speeds."
